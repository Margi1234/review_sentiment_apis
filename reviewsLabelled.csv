1,1143,Fanfreakentastic!,"Long ago, when I was young, my Dad and I auditioned new speakers to go along with his Macintosh gear we settled on up picking the 104.2's which were simply amazing at the time and award winning to boot. Now I needed to upgrade my speakers but I was quite nervous about it as I already had a nice combination of gear and speakers. I was walking by KEF at a trade show looked over to what I was hearing and literally doubled back and did a double take. I couldn't believe the sound I heard from the LS50’s. It was so memorable I remembered the sound in my head and purchased the speakers a year later. After breaking them in I can't be happier, the imaging is amazing and the midrange, which is so hard to get right it fantastic. I was also really surprised by the low frequency extension, simply amazing for a speaker with a 5.25"" low/mid driver and no DSP. I have had over thirty people in ""The Chair"" and all end up with their jaws on the floor in disbelief while I'm grinning from ear to ear, anticipating when the parties over so I can sit and listen. KEF HIT IT OUT OF THE PARK with these speakers. An unbelievable value! Take the time to break them in (100 hours or better) and you will be blown away. Oh and I have been in the audio business for twenty-five years and am a musician so listening to music and creating music is pretty much all I do. One last thing, I am also into Hi-Res audio among other forms or audio and I was super happy that the LS50’s extend to 40KHz which so happens to meet the JAS Hi-Res standard.",P
2,1143,Landmark Purchase!,"The LS50s are simply some of the finest bookshelf/stand-mount speakers I have ever heard. I've heard comparative offerings from most of the major players (and some of the smaller ones) and while many models have their redeeming qualities, these babies just flat out sing like nothing else.

It's remarkable - when dialed in right, and fed/driven by qualified gear, they actually disappear from the room and the only thing left is just you and the music. It seems like such a simple thing, but until you actually experience it, descriptions pale in comparison.

In a nutshell, when these things are at their best they perform on such a high level it's ridiculous. 

Two things to note, for potential buyers:

1) 8 ohms seems a bit optimistic. Measured performance, averaged out, is probably more like 6 ohms (and as low as 4 - per Stereophile). Just be sure your amplifier is up to the task. My Parasound A21 has no trouble at all but does run a bit warmer than with some B & W's.

2) They are indeed a little less sensitive than some others, but don't let that dissuade you. Just be mindful of it.

3) The bass these produce is incredible. It's more than enough for my oddly shaped 9x20x10 room (and my neighbors). If you have a large room and/or just like a lot of presence with the lowest octave then you'll want a sub.


The better the gear you can throw at these the better they will perform. I am currently in awe of how awesome they are and how luck I am to own them.


If you're reading these reviews, just do yourself a solid and pick up a pair. Try to buy from your local dealer if at all possible. Often they'll work with you, and supporting your community is more important now than ever!

The LS50s will add joy to your life. And in the end, joy is what this is all about.

3,1143,Works fine with low-powered tubes!,"A local dealer made me an offer I couldn't refuse, so I bought these speakers without having an opportunity to audition them. I was a bit uncertain because the specs indicate that the LS50s require some power, and my (restored) Fisher 400 tube receiver is rated at about 28 wpc. 

I had nothing to worry about; the Fisher has plenty of juice to get the LS50s singing in my little 9 x 12 listening room. Compared to my previous speakers (rated at 90dB efficiency vs. the KEF's 86dB efficiency), I only have to notch up the volume knob slightly higher to achieve the same level.

My conclusion is the quality of the power source is more important to the LS50s than the amp's nominal rating; the transformers on the Fisher 400 are pretty beefy.",P
4,1143,Excellent workmanship and service,"I've had KEF (3005s) as my original HT system for several years in my den and am very happy with them; but I always wanted a set of stereo speakers for my living room for those cozy fireplace moments. I tested number of speakers including dynaudio, B&W, MAs and several others. The LS50 blew them all away in terms of sound stage and clarity. Currently powering them with an emotiva xpa-200 amp and their new dc-1 DAC. I listen to mostly digital music and these sound awesome in this combination! Thanks for making my holiday season even greater.",P
5,1143,LS50= Unparalled excellence,"Speakers: LS50 (2.1 with Velodyne 8"" SW) 
AV receiver: Marantz SR6008

Let me run down how this search began by saying few words: I was looking for an under 3000 dollar system for my room of 12'X10' room. I initially was thinking of 5.1 HT system but found out soon that it was a great compromise on quality ( systems tested: BW CM1/CM5 + 683; Def tech (bipolars). I heard kef for the first time when my brother happened to get R100s (in UK) and he was very very happy with them (stereo set up). That prompted me to research on this and initially thought of Q900 and Q700 (not Q500- bad review or no good reviews). I soon realized that large speakers might be too large for my room size. And then began looking for R100 series; with excellent reviews I almost wanted to buy them but luckily were not available in texas or in KefDirect store. That prompted be to look for LS50; and the more I knew about them, I got more excited about these. When I called one of the kef dealers in Dallas, he said "" LS50 are the reason for us to start selling KEF and we are very pleased with performance"" . I took a gamble and got them finally after few hiccups with ordering process (minor). 

I am not an audiophile by any standard but I can certainly appreciate fine music and this is a very brief summary of what i think
Built: Clean; classy; and Beautiful (All the people who walked in the room- first word- they look nice), heavy
Performance: This must be one of the purchases that I made ( a costly one relatively) where I feel that this is indeeed WORTH every penny. The sound is amazing in all standard. The treble is a world apart ( i personally feel BMW 600 or CM series cannot match the quality of the it and I am myself surprised to see the quality of sound that comes out from these speakers. The depth of sound produced is mind boggling in literal sense. More i listen these are getting more better. they do have Great Mids and a fantastic woofer ( although I must say, for my room a woofer makes music Complete). I placed these beauties 2.5 mtrs apart secondary to room restrictions at 10 inches about my ear level)
Connection time/ process: EASY

I am very happy customer currently and I do not regret my purchase and Infact I would highly recommend this product to anyone who really wants to enjoy a clean and in depth and most importantly non fatiguing music and even more importantly very beautiful looking speakers. 

Great Job Kef and Now you have a new fan",P
6,1143,Highly Recommended,"I listened to some KEF floorstanding reference speakers about 10 years at a speaker boutique and got hooked on high end audio. Unfortunately, I've always been buying speakers on the affordable end of the audiophile spectrum and constantly bitten by the upgrade bug as a result. These speakers are about twice as expensive as any that I have previously owned but they deliver far above their price range.Perhaps my favorite feature is their ability to play perfectly (to my ears) when off axis. I don't have a dedicated listening room, so it has been common for the best listening position to be some spot standing in the middle of the room. Now, I can fully enjoy my music from anywhere in the room. Upgrade bug officially squashed.

FYI - I mostly listen to classic and indie rock. Power with an Exposure amp and a Centrance DAC with all-digital sources.",P
7,1143,Giant Killers - Can't Be Beaten for Less than 5-10x The Price,"I was stunned that all the reviews were right about these fantastic speakers - they truly are Giant Killers, especially for their price.

They're beautiful and their sound qualities are just as amazing - when set up correctly. They do require special care in set up to sound up to their potential. Any critical comments you may have seen, likely result from improper set up. 

To sound their best, they must be placed out in the room, away from the walls, and with their ports fully open. In that configuration they really do disappear in a wall of lifelike sound, with a great soundstage and imaging. 

Of course their other sound qualities are superior as well - great bass, mids, highs, tone, tenure, texture, timbre - very real, lifelike sound, without any boxy constraints. 

They really do have bass, despite their specs - though, if you're a HT, or car audio buff, who loves inaccurate, boomy sound, you may be disappointed. I'm using the R400b with them, but they really don't need it, except for the very lowest notes.

They also require a powerful amp with high current output - 200+ w per channel into 8ohms. They're fairly inefficient. 

And... I'm using them with the DSP Anti-mode 2.0 to eliminate the ""room boom"" - especially with a sub. Makes integrating a sub a ""piece of cake."" And... provides a very good pre-amp, as well. Add a tube buffer, as I have, and the sound doesn't get much better. 

A great source, such as a great SACD player with XLR cables makes everything even better!

Do yourself a favor... and get a pair of these... unless ""you have money to burn,"" and can spend $50K on your system, which is what it will take to better them. ",P
8,1143,It's all true~!,"Even with very little break-in, I can tell you that John Atkinson in Stereophile was absolutely correct: Class A for smaller rooms. Also, read the What HiFi review. 

These are solid as a rock, gorgeous finish, and provide the most amazing clarity I've ever heard. Wow! What a soundstage! Don't hesitate. If you love classics, Jazz, and vocal music, you will be in heaven.",P
9,1143,These speakers are little gems!,"I have owned a number of loudspeakers over the years starting with Polk, Martin Logan, Magnepan and Gallo. While they all had their strengths, none have impressed me as much as the LS50's. From the excellent build quality to the balanced sound and deceptive small physical size, these speakers are impressive. The LS 50's disappear and present the music with accuracy-,clear highs, articulate, realistic vocals and punchy bass-the LS50's are so enjoyable to listen to. For the size and price, they are hard to beat.",P
10,1143,"Overall, a great pair.","Overall, they are delightful to listen to. Add a sub and you might never need a big pair of speakers. 

I have them matched with the following:

Olive Media Server 


Test Music 

Vinyl - the most crucial test 

Buckingham Nicks - ""Crying in the Night"" from German LP Pressing - Incredible album - musically and sonically - but has never been re-released and the US vinyl copies universally suck - the German pressing is quiet and Lindsey's guitars jumped out into the room with me 

Fleetwood Mac - ""Dreams"" - from recent 45 rpm double LP - This pressing beats the Japanese SACD and the US DVD-A. Its often a toss-up between these three formats (if a recording is lucky enough to get all 3) but the vinyl in this case is the winner - clean, quiet and ultra-transparent 

Olivia Newton-John - ""Country Girl"" - from Japanese Pressing of Long Live Love LP - Japanese vinyl is meticulously well crafted and regardless of what you think of this aritst,, her early country recordings (coming out of England) with Cliff Richard's old Shadows band on back-up and producing - are magnificent. Great guitars, superb sonic layers, and a clear, clean voice that some speakers can't get right - but not the KEFs! 

CD 

Eagles - ""New Kid in Town"" from the West German Target CD - very early ""flat"" transfer - sounded superb - this is the Eagles CD to own - later versions have tinkering with the sonics 

SACD 

Eric Clapton - ""Give ME Strength"" from 461 Ocean Boulevard - guitars were warm and sweet and jumped out at you 

Olive Server - I hate compression but Olive does pretty well 

Vanessa Williams - ""Midnight Blue"" from ""Everlasting Love"" - great cover of the Melissa Manchester classic - sounded much better than I expected. 

Overall, a great pair. ",P
11,1143,"Design is not for everyone, but excellent sound for the money",Amazing clarity and detail on vocals and acoustics. I really wish they had grills though as the shiny brass drivers can be an eyesore (they are for me.),P
12,1143,Simply Amazing,"I must say that I am amazed at these little loudspeakers! My current speakers are ProAc Response 2.5 which were purchased well over 10 years ago at a cost of $5,000 – the current model is called D28 which represents a slight improvement and retails for $6,250 . The KEF LS50 simply buries them! Dynamics, imaging, clarity – it’s all there. Alright, so the ProAc’s have a stronger bass, but frankly I prefer the KEF’s lighter touch, seems more in scale and certainly adequate.

I am finding myself pulling out all these old records I haven’t listened to for years and enjoying it immensively, never would have thought that a mere change in technology could rekindle musical enjoyment, but there’s no arguing with success.

Makes me wonder what The Blade can do – turn heavy metal into violin sonatas?

16,1158,R400B The Perfect Match for R900s,"Accurate, tight and musical are just a few words I would use to describe the KEF R400B subwoofer. The identity of every low end source is obvious and spectacular through these subs. Hidden details on otherwise familiar songs are revealed like sonic jewels. I am currently running 2 of these paired with KEF R900s crossed over at 40hz rounding out my 2 channel set up. This combination is a match made in audio heaven.",P

18,1151,Gorgeous!,"I sold a pair of Magnepan 1.7s to get these, largely due to the Magnepan's poor performance in the wife approval department. I auditioned extensively comparably priced speakers from Paradigm, Sonus Faber, and KEF. No contest. The combination of great build quality and outstanding sound takes the KEFs to the top. I am extremely pleased, and so is my wife. Awesome product.",P
19,1151,Beautiful,"Wonderful speakers, and they look amazing. They arrived right on schedule - and in perfect condition. I based my purchase on quite a bit of research online and I'm thrilled with the result. Here's a picture, right out of the box: http://sdrv.ms/HKg7x8",P
20,1155,The speakers are absolutely beautiful,"Just wanted to chime in and say thanks for all the posts in this thread, and to give a little info on my recent KEF speaker purchases. I have spent the last three weeks with my KEF R700s. I also got a R600c at the same time and am about to go ahead and finish off the speaker setup with the R800ds and a sub.

My room isn't dedicated, it's just a spare bedroom in the middle of the house. I've got a Panny projector and a 106"" screen. Because of that I went for the walnut instead of the gloss black.

Here are just a few things about using the KEF R series in a home theater room with a projector.

1) The speakers are absolutely beautiful without the grills attached. The walnut finish is as fine a finish as any piece of furniture I've bought for my home in the last five years. That being said, when it's movie time, I put the grills on. The shiny aluminum rings and shiny Uni-Q driver really can be distracting without the grills on while playing movies.

2) I'm also running these speakers on a recently purchased Marantz AV7701 pre/pro into a Parasound Halo A52.

3) My room is about 13.5' x 13'. Not ideal for acoustics, but the R700s aren't too bass heavy for me. In fact, I'm probably going to order to R400b because I just want a little bit of bass support. Not anything too boomy. I just don't think the speakers need it in my room.

I first got a test listen to the R500's at a dealer in Dallas and I was very impressed with how neutral they sounded. They were running on Parasound Halo JC1 mono amps. I really only had a chance to listen to CD's as a source at that dealer.

I have been happy with my old home theater speakers from a long time ago but finally decided to go for a great system. I was still using an old Denon AVR1400 with analog outputs from many upgraded DVD and Blu-Ray players over the years. I had experience with KEF in the past. I helped my parents pick out a home theater system using KEF speakers like the Reference 100 and 90s and then upgraded their fronts to KEF RDM 2's (I think). I loved the neutrality of the speakers compared to my DefTech's I'd always had.

The thing that strikes me about the R700s is they don't really have that distinctive flat/neutral sound I'm used to in the older KEF series of speakers. Maybe it's the new Uni-Q with the Blade technology. I did audition some PSB Imagine T2's just for comparison and those were very nice speakers as well (I thought). These speakers are pretty awesome after spending three weeks with them. It's the best set of speakers I've ever owned. They are a lot more lively in the higher frequencies than I remember KEF being. But acoustic guitars and strings still sound accurate without being overly bright.

What has been the biggest difference for me is in how revealing and controlled they are. It's hard for me to judge how loud they are playing. I can go from 72db to 77db on my Marantz and everything is so clear just at a higher volume. It's not like anything I've experienced before with my own speakers. There is no level of volume that makes you think the speakers are being pushed to their limits. (I dare not push them too far being this new). They just stay composed and play at a higher volume level.

The other thing for me that has been surprising with two channel music is they have such a great separation in the soundstage. It's more revealing of left and right channels than my DefTech satellites were. I had always read that towers wouldn't be able to create the type of soundstage satellite speakers are capable of reproducing. The KEFs also were so revealing. I could tell after a couple of days of listening to vinyl that the higher frequencies were too harsh. I was really worried the KEF neutrality I was looking for wasn't in these speakers. It turned out the speakers were just revealing to me that my phono preamp needed to have it's settings lowered when loading my MC cartridge. I made a few tweaks to my phono preamp and another world opened up.

I couldn't tell that on my former system even though the Parasound Halo amp was already in that setup chain.

For movies, they are great speakers as well. I just do so much critical two-channel listening on vinyl that I'm not quite as good at evaluating movie sound through the speakers. The R600c is a great match with the R700s. Just a seamless soundfield up front.

Again with movies, I am still re-teaching myself to judge volume levels too. You hear everything so well that you have to say to yourself, 'I'd like it to have a little more volume.'

I presume this is the biggest difference between the Q and the R series. I've read a lot about the Q series really opening up at higher volume levels. From my listening to movies and vinyl so far, the Rs are very good at producing a nice, clean, clear soundstage at medium listening levels.

I'm just really enjoying these speakers. I still have plenty to do to finish off the system with cables, interconnects and getting some people in to do some in-wall installation for the surrounds and projector chords, install new outlets, etc., but I couldn't be happier with holding out for the R series.

I'm a little bit of an analog freak and I do love movies. But I've really been blown away with the R700s for two-channel music. Just get some help carrying those speakers if you pick them up from your dealer. Those boxes are massive!

The wood finishes are beautiful. But if you are buying for just two-channel listening you should definitely go for the gloss black or white finishes. They are really pretty pieces of furniture with the grills off either way.",P
24,1165,Very Pleased,"While I was originally quite disappointed to learn that the Q200 was no longer available in cherry, I am still happy with my dealers recommendation to mate the Q200 with my Q700s. While the Q200 has had limited use (more music than movies) it is working well in the new system and I am very pleased.",P
25,1163,Awesome speaker,"These speakers sound great. If I did not know any better I would swear I was running them with a sub..but my vintage Harman Kardon 330c receiver that I have them connected to, does not have a sub out. :-). The Uni-Q driver is impressive.",P
26,1163,Great Speakers,These are my first pair of Kef's and I am impressed! I intended to use them fronts and rears for a 5.1 surround but I was so blown away that I bought the Q500's for the fronts! I am satisfied with my purchase and would recommend to anyone looking for an entry level setup that sounds awesome!,P
27,1160,Best I Ever Had,"I too bought these blind at the recommendation of a local dealer. I needed something that was not too big and had high WAF. I wanted the cherry but production delays and the discontinuance of the Q200 in cherry, made me go with walnut. Once getting the streaming from my PC in synch, I was absolutely amazed and pleased with my choice. The dealer was spot-on. Best Bang for the Buck on <$1k speakers. The Q200 is quite good as well, although movies were a secondary consideration.",P
28,1160,Bang for the buck,"Replaced a pair of twenty year old speakers that were top of the line back then. Gone through a complete upgrade of my system and needed a capable pair of speakers. Bought them from a store in Saskatoon. Running a CEC cd through a Benchmark to a VDH to a 4BST. High quality interconnects and cables. They sounded good, but messy, at first. Five hours in they opened up and made music. Easy to discern individual sounds and instruments when there is a lot happening in the soundstage. Solid imaging. Could be a bit deeper, but that may improve with more hours and positioning experimentation. Voices are the person singing in front of you. They are getting smoother and more open as the hours add up. They need power. Wimpy amps need not apply. Bass is taught. Highs are non-fatiguing. They are capable of great dynamics and will play loud, clean, and do so like music! Would loved to have heard the R's. I suspect they are that much better yet. Maybe move these to the AV system and move up to the R's? Well done KEF!",P
29,1160,Truly amazing,"I purchased these blindy,all I csn say when i brought them home unpacked and connected to my Anthem I225, I was literally blown awayv these Q700 are revealing, I was hearing things in music I was missing.

Second, the entire package for the KEF X300A is impressive:
The sound quality is *stunning*. The sound stage is deeply 3-dimensional.
The layout of the connection ports, controls, & power is simple & ergonomic.
The design of the speakers is aesthetically pleasing.
The manufacturing is to an almost artisanal-level of craftsmanship.
The materials and components are top-notch.
The packing of the speakers in the box is thoughtful, secure, & clean.
The *cardboard* constituting the box is sturdy & hi-quality.
The feng shui of the entire experience is, shall we say, harmonious
and, i'm willing to bet, would astound Steve Jobs. :)

Third: The KEF X300A is a complete audio delivery system designed
for the digital source of yr choice: iPod, laptop, or desktop.
The KEF X300A provides an onboard DAC that can handle up
to (96kHz 24-bit) files and bypasses the source computer's
built-in (usually lo-quality) DAC thru a USB connection.
The KEF X300A is *not* ""computer speakers"" in some low-bar
attempt to exceed the paltry audio out of most computers.

Finally be *forewarned*: if u acquire the KEF X300A, u will be
kicked up more than a couple of notches and feel compelled to ditch yr
.mp3 files for .aiff (44.1kHz 16 bit) & hi-rez FLAC (96kHz 24-bit) files!

If yr source is a laptop, u will want to stream those hi-rez files off an SSD:
Samsung 840 EVO-Series 1TB 2.5"" SATA III SSD; MZ-7TE1T0BW:

One more appreciated touch: i've spoken a couple of times to the folks at
KEFdirect and have found them to be helpful, considerate, & accommodating.

To get ""CD"" quality (44.1kHz 16-bit) tracks, as opposed to .mp3, rip CDs

35,1201,Worth every dime!,"I ordered these on 4 March. They arrived 7 March, The quality is, simply stated superior. Sound presents an aural image that would make an audiophile take notice; particularly in such a small package. Well done KEF.",P
36,1201,As good as it gets,"I wanted access to my main music library (being) converted to digital music audio files (AIFF) including Hi-Res downloads with no loss in fidelity, without spending a ton of dollars for integrated or separates, cables galore and as close as possible to the SQ (sound quality) I experience from my main system which includes KEF Reference 107s (circa 1986). Be it known, I am wedded to KEFs -- in my bedroom, HT and now a fourth system. I also wanted simple and direct setup. I chose speaker stands made to order instead of a desktop configuration and adjusted the EQ. The supplied plugs to regulate bass were appreciated but not needed. Of the several options for connecting to my main system in another room (5m cable made this possible), I chose USB (hoping for the best SQ) from Mac Mini to the X300As. The other connection options, Airplay via Airport Express, Bluetooth dongle received as a pre-order gift from KEF, or stereo 3.5mm analog port were not implemented. First impressions of the SQ were disappointing playing files in iTunes no matter what resolution. Hmmm, new AB amps, new 96/24 Dacs, new everything. Launched my favorite player, Amarra Symphony, and replayed the same files. Ah Ha! Different result: Everything changed (for the much-much-better). So this is what X300As sound like even new out of the box. I was delightfully surprised by the ample bass, very favorable mids, the Highs out of the gate need some more time. Cymbals and drums, horns, voices were resonant without sibilance. Coherence evident. Sound stage big. To be thorough, ease of adjusting the gain visually or by touch is not: While I appreciate the admonition to lower the gain to avoid damage to the drivers, there is no détente that I can feel to discern the middle position, or if there is a middle for the gain adjustment knob, I was able to detect that position; and a contrasting color on the knob itself would have made it easier under certain conditions. While I accept the responsibility for a longer USB cable when needed I would have appreciated longer USB cables then what was supplied. I doubt very many buyers will use them for desktop with the level of performance these speakers are capable of delivering. To sum up: The X300A is well designed and fabricated, attractive aesthetically, and for the price and performance, the X300As are as good as it gets.

37,1203,Convenient Upgrade from the X300A,"Having used the KEF X300A speakers in my desktop system for over a year I was already familiar with their superior sound quality, dynamics, excellent build quality and easy operation. Properly oriented on the desktop they provide an realistic soundstage and immersive listening experience. The move to the KEF X300AW cousin was primarily for the added convenience of the wireless operation.

Observations:

-the KEF X300AW sounds exactly the same as the KEF X300A

38,1199,Great Product,"I got these headphones as a gift. I'd never heard of this company before, and Have always thought the Bose was the pioneer of quality sound in a small package. Boy was I wrong. These Headphones by-far out sound any modern day headphone that is on the market, From Beats by Dre, to klipsch, these blow them out the water. I will be converting my whole home theater system to KEF. What a great sounding speaker.",P
39,1199,Just Wanted to Add Some More,"In my previous review I failed to mention the fact that the M500 can be easily powered by an i-pod. With 15 hours in, the phones have opened up even more & with that comes an increase in volume that is as clean & pure as it is at lower volume. In addition, the 500's outperform several open back phones that I have such as the Grado SR 225i & Sennheiser HD-598. Important as they are open back which usually denotes better sound butwith tha tcomes a great deal of leakage eliminating the idea of portablity due to outside noises. Not here, not at all. These are very portable and very lightweight.",P
40,1199,Oh No Not Another Company Coming Out With Headphones,"An electronics salesman told me the KEF was going to introduce their version of over the ear headphones as well as in-ear phones. My immediate reaction was ""oh no"", not another company entering the market. After I settled down it began to sink in, ""this is KEF"" meaning I have to look into this. I am an audiophile but not the type who examines each & every detail to the point of overkill. Too much detail is too much for me. Let me say that this was easily the best headphone purchase I've ever made & I've made way too many.I have some top rated phones like the PSB MU 4 2 as well as the Sennheiser Momentum,, & so forth.) Those cost more than the M500's & don't come close to the precise details, imaging, imaging ,soundstage, etc. The 500's are pure magic when it comes to reproducing all types of music & do so on a grand scale. Beauty & comfort make up the rest of this very fine product which operates with such ease. The fit & finish is typical KEF (meaning as good as it gets) & while they are on ear phones, they provide very good isolation. I've taken them outside & walked sevral miles in very warm weather & the faux leather ear pads & headband do not heat up like so many other headphones do. Am I surprised?, of course not because I figured KEF would wait until they got it right. So back to the Oh no response, because this 500's surpass all of my other phones, Oh yes, applies here. The case is very nice & the cables are flat & wonderfully flexible. The i-pod cable as well as the standard one are very high quality & blend well with the magnificent aluminum body. At $299.99 they're an absolute bargain, bar none. My wife doesn't believe me when I told her that the 500's may very well be my last headphone purchase. I'm really not sure where I would go from here so I'll leave it at that.",P
41,1200,Tip's,"I love the sound,but the seal is not good! I have tried all three tip's but they do not go in far enough for me.",N
42,1200,WOW-Amazing sound-Very KEF like-Love it,"To begin with, I must say that I am a very satisfied KEF Reference 103.2 speaker owner since 1983 (30 years). I love the sound of those speakers so much that when I learn that KEF was now producing headphones, I had to try them. Since I spend more then 10 hours commuting weekly (in a mix of buses,trains and subways), I decided for the in-ear M200.

A few years ago, I did try some well known other brand in-ear headphones in the same price range but I was not satisfied. The sound was good but not good enough to make me forget the many disadvantages. You could not walk nor eat while listening to music because every slite move of your neck or jaw muscles was changing the ear-canal shape and affecting the sound quality. At the same time, I could hear the sound of the bud tip rubbing inside my ear-canal. From that experience, I decided that ""in-ear"" was not for me. Nevertheless, since the M200 were from a company I respect so much and even though there were no review available at that time, I decided to try ""in-ear"" again to make those so many commuting hours more enjoyable. 

The M200s comes in a very well made and ""Apple"" like classy packaging. They looks very high tech and well engineered. I was blown away by the sound. I never expected that the sound would be so good, very detailed and crisp, voices are so natural and basses are clean tight and so deep (not boomy). On one particular song, I was hearing cracking sound from the recording studio floor that I never heard before. So enjoyable, very Hi-Fi, Bravo KEF.

There are only two drawbacks. FIRST, in-ear is definetly not for everyone. The M200 are not some kind of tiny, mini buds. They have some volume for some reasons. Each bud is a two-way speaker arranged much like a big Uni-Q driver (used in high-end KEF speakers) and, all those very low bass sounds required some room/volume to expand. This is why they are not small and that the flexible arms are nessary to support and position them properly. It took me four days to find the proper fitting and positionning to get the full pleasure that those headphones can induce. Now I feel that you can definitely walk confortably with them but you will probably not run nor ear or chew gum while listening to music with them. 

SECOND, while I love my KEF speakers for rendering a realistic 3D like sound with precise instruments positionning on the stage IN FRONT OF THE LISTENER, a headphone, ANY headphone, will never render that same sensation of space just because the music feels more in your head then on the stage in front of you. But at the same time, you would not expect either to hear a Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, a Dire Strait, a Patricia Barber or an Adele concert in the train.

Anyway, I now have 800+ albums in my iPod library that I have to re-discover with my KEF M200 while the other commuters have to figure out where does that smile come from.",P
43,1200,Awful Fit,Great sound if your ear canal is the size of the Chunnel.... would you please consider adding foam tips as a possible option to get these to both fit better and be more comfortable? As of now they will be coming back. Bummed out as I love my KEF home speaker system.,N
44,1200,WOW... Hifi-damn straight,"I just got these from my local dealer here in CA. All i have to say is WOW.

I used to use Monster Beats over ear headphones, which were ok but I can't run in them. So I decided to try some in-ear headphones. My dad got me into KEF years ago and when I heard these would be available I waited.

Anyway, what I love about them is that they SOUND AMAZING, especially comparing them to my Monster Beats. Relaly, WOW.

But what is also cool is that they are great for using while working out - the arm that wraps around your ear is extremely adjustable and malleable. I just love them. I may actually eventually get the over ear ones just for the hell of it. 

Nice job kef!",P
45,1200,good,THE SOUND IS EXCELLENT BUT THE THE DISCOMFORT IS IT DOES NOT SIT IN EAR PROPERLY IT KEEPS ON COMING OUT NOT SECURE,A
46,1208,"Great sound, Easy listening. Enjoyable","Sound quality is Great. They produce the mid frequencies and the high frequencies with ease. They are well balanced and perfect when paired with an in-room sub-woofer to fill in the bass. Throw in a little insulation behind the speaker and they really sound great. Very non-directional sound. A bright White color and attractive magnetic grill make for a great high end in-ceiling speaker. I've installed over 30 now. Strong rigid frame, light weight. quality crossover board and parts. All customers are very pleased with sound. A little on the mid-to high side in price, but you should only have buy speakers once. These are the kind you only buy once, therefore a good value overall. think of how many times you've had to buy amplifiers, A/V sources, and TVs. Invest in the best speakers now.",P
47,1229,Great sound,"I was using Klipsch outdoor and they had a tweeter go out. When I replaced them with the KEF, it was a huge improvement. Much more open and natural sound!",P
48,1203,"Very good, with reservations","Great build, looks and sound quality. Rather heavy.  Works well with itunes.  Overall I am very satisfied with the quality of the speakers, with one ongoing problem.  The network connection is not very stable, and despite being in a small room in close proximity to the wireless router, the speakers occasionally lose connection with the network, resulting in having to re-pair the speakers with the smartphone app.  This has occurred over a half dozen times in a 3 month period without any other network issues.  I have not approached KEF about this and don't know if there are software updates available to address this problem. Otherwise I would not hesitate to recommend.",P
51,1166,my pair and others (per audio forums )were bult incorrectly /out of phase from each other  and tech  denied problem,these were not built as mirror pairs but rather are identical. The result is that they do not image correctly since they are out of phase with each other. Tech assistance denied problem and made statement that phase would have no impact on imaging. I corrected phase problem myself  and they are just fine now. In a large room like mine they do not put out enough volume to functiuon as good side surrounds but are actually pretty good rear surrounds.,N
56,1158,Good things come in a small package,"The R400b subwoofer by far blows away its competition  in such a small tight package. It drives anything that is thrown at it effortlessly. The sound it produces you would think you had a monster subwoofer or two. I have this in a 18'x18' room.  Do not be afraid of this with two 9"" drivers. You will be blown away what you hear. It pairs very well with the R series of speakers. Great Job KEF...",P
58,1203,keep getting disconnected on the network,"great speakers, as I love the KEF line up.

I have both the 300A, and the 300 AW.  Same good quality, just that I turned my wireless pair into a wired pair.  KEF can refund me the $200, and I'm cool with that.

Gary",N
59,1200,Really comfortable and sound great,"My wife got these for me for my birthday and I have to say, as both an avid runner and audio enthusiast these are really great! Not sure what others are talking about with the fit. The product comes iwth great eartips (called Comply foam tips) that fit really good in my ears. I use the medium sized ones.  Love the travel case that comes with the product and the bendy arm that wraps around the ear for a secure fit is really soft and comfortalble, and also really malleable. My opinion is that these are really well built and really well engineered. Nice job Kef folks.",P
60,1200,Nice earbuds,"Great sound, feels heavy and well made, great company. I have you rReference 104/2s still and they are the best. M200s are great. Secure fit arm works nice but I had to get used to it. After a small amount o ftime I dont even know its there. These are comfortable.",P
61,1197,Excellent quality,best of the best,P
65,1158,Kef 400b is a must subwoofer,"The Kef r400b is an enginering feat and an audio delight. It compliments my mainspeaker in reaching the depths of sound and is and exciting participant  in reaching the thunderous bass of Rock and pop and instrumental/classical music is a natural get out of the way effort. 
Agreat sub and highly recommended.  Buying a second one for evening out some bass nulls. Take care, a customer for life, John M.",P
67,1153,"Holly Cow, What Phenomenal Sound","I am of course the very very lucky winner of the HT-Guys 10th year anniversary grand prize – the Kef R-Series 5.1.2 Dolby Atmos Speaker System: 4 x R100, 1 x R200c, 1 x R400b, 2 x R50.  I am so grateful to you guys, and to Dippin from KEF for this amazing prize.

 

I apologise for the delay of this long overdue email, but with work, travel and other engagements, I did not have the time to fully test out the speaker system before now. Holly cow what phenomenal sound.

 

First thing I wanted to point out is that I never bought individual speakers in the past.  I have a limited budget for my home ‘entertainment’ setup, and I always put more of an emphasis on the television itself than the audio equipment attached to it.  I did have ambiophonic setups in the past, but I’ve always had all-in-one systems with the inexpensive speakers that came with it.  I always thought that the quality was decent, that I could experience all the audio mixes available correctly and that the speakers were fine for my needs in a small apartment.  My last setup was an Onkyo HT-S5500, 7.1 Channel Home Theater Package.  The Onkyo HT-R591 receiver that came with it does have the height input, so I was able to plug in the R50 speakers, even though it is not an Atmos enabled receiver.

 

Wow, what a jump, I feel like I went straight from from preschool to postdoctoral studies.  The first thing that is apparent is the shear power of the R-series set of speakers, which most certainly is due to the bigger drivers.  Prior to receiving the R-400b subwoofer, I had done a calibration with the rest of the speakers.  I was surprised how well these small speakers could handle low-end sounds.

 

After a kerfuffle with U.S. / Canada customs (basically they destroyed the subwoofer and sent it back to KEF), I received the R400b.  I did a proper three-position calibration using the Audyssey microphone.  Well wow … what can I say.

 

Music:

 

I am so used to listening to mp3s or streams on the go, that I didn’t think that it would matter much to me listening to music on such a system.  Boy was I wrong … all of a sudden you rediscover new elements in music you thought you knew extremely well.  I pay for the Rdio music service, which basically allows me access to a seemingly limitless catalogue of albums from a browser.  There is also a Roku app for this service and this is the main source of streaming music to my audio setup.  I realise this is not an ideal source, but the 192 kbps streams are good enough for me.  There is a 320 kbps version, but I don’t really hear a difference.  I would love for someone to point out a piece of music where they actually hear the difference between a 192 kbps vs 320 kbps bitrate, and what to look out for.

 

I decided to use music I am quite familiar with to test out the system.

 

“David Bowie: Earthling” – I’m Afraid of Americans (Rdio)

 

There are such a variety of tones in this track and the speakers render all superbly.

I’ve never felt the low tones this way; not a wash, just exactly the tones as they are supposed to be … but with such power that after 1 min I had to stop it in fear of forever ruining my reputation as good neighbor.  This is going to be tricky … I’m going to need to spy on my neighbours to find out when they are not home so I can fully enjoy my setup.

 

“Miles Davis: Ascenceur pour l’échafaud” soundtrack (CD & Rdio)

 

I have listened to this music for such a long time on various formats (tape, CD, streaming), so I figured this would be a good test case.

 

The first thing that was obvious was the hiss in the 1998 CD release of the 1958 recording.  I never noticed this before, not that I was paying attention to it, but this is a testament to the quality of the speakers that I can notice it.  On the re-mastered version, which was available on Rdio, the hiss was absent as expected, however I did notice a bit of gating (is that the correct term?).  Basically I felt that the removal of the noise signature took a little away from the original elements, especially noticeable on the tenor sax.  But this was very slight and obviously has nothing to do with the speakers, but the mastering itself.  What a wonderful experience to listen to this piece on these speakers.  After twiddling around with the different modes of the receiver, I stopped on the Dolby Pro Logic IIz – Height setting, since it seem to provide more ‘presence’ … the effect of which gave the impression of having the musicians in the room with me.  For the first time I was aware of each individual player with all there expressiveness.  This was absolutely clear when I could hear each individual brush stroke on the snare and the subtle accents.  It gave me a whole new appreciation of the musicianship and the timeless quality of this recording.   For those of you thinking of getting the R50s to enhance your sound, I strongly recommend it as it gives more breadth and more frontal power, which enhance the illusion of having the musicians there with you.

 

Actually I'd like to know what do you guys recommend as audio mode when listening to music ?



""Gyorgy Ligeti"" – Continuum / Atmospheres / Ramifications

 

There are recordings that just beg for a multi channel aural space, anything by Gyorgy Ligeti for instance.  For those not familiar with this composer, just think of any memorable moment in a Stanley Kubrick film and chances are it’s enhanced by music by Ligeti.  It’s a music that requires precise speakers, because his compositions often play with rhythmic layers that create phasing, where every note is important.  If the sound is muddled, the effect is lost.  The KEF speakers render these effects perfectly, since again, the individual voices can clearly be heard.

 

Everything I put through it (Jazz, Rock, Folk, Classical, Electronic) sounded phenomenal to me. I never thought that surrounding myself with sound would be so pleasant, but also heighten my awareness of the musicianship by hearing very precisely the contribution of each player.  This was only made possible because of the dynamics and accurateness of these R-Series speakers.

 

 

Movies & TV:

 

I have very few 7.1 mixed films in my collection, as I tend to purchase more foreign classics in ‘full glorious mono’ (as a friend would put it), but I did have ""Prometheus"" by Ridley Scott, which I used to test out the speakers.  Right from the start, with the rolling military snare drums of the 20th Century Fox Fanfare and thunderous thump of the bass drum, I was transported into the theater.  In the introductory scene, there is a waterfall … the roar of it was quite phenomenal and then a massive alien ship hovers into the frame with substantial low tones passing overhead.  In the past, I’ve had systems that could deliver a good rumble to the room, but this is the first time I can say I could distinguish the tones of these two low hums … and even though there was absolutely no denying the power of these tones, I didn’t feel that it was simply just making the walls shake … it was clearly connected to what I was seeing on screen and totally engulfed me into the experience of being there.  Granted, this has to do with good sound design, but I think I would not have gotten this if it weren’t for these speakers.  With regards to the R50s, I have the impression they were also quite active during this sequence, because I did have the impression that the low tones of the ship were coming somewhat above me (though I realise that probably all speakers are involved to achieve this specialization).

 

I’ve also been listening lately to the Daredevil series on Netflix.  Having a Roku, I do get the Dolby Digital + mix.  In light of the fact that this character is blind and has an enhanced auditory sense, the sound mix is used quite effectively to convey this ability, especially during fight sequences.  All the thumps and positioning effects are quite vivid with these speakers and dialogue very clear in the center channel.

 

Sincerely, KEF literally brought the theater into my home and now I understand why you guys (Braden & Ara) sometime say how much nicer it is to have this experience in your own home.  As you often pointed out, the speakers make all the difference … and now I fully agree, speakers should be the number one priority of any enthusiast.

 

When I’ll have the budget for it (in the new year), I will get a full blown Atmos enabled receiver and let you guys know of my impressions.  For now I’ll just be enjoying the speakers thoroughly on a daily basis.

 

Thank you HTGuys and KEF… you rocked my world!

I’ve never felt the low tones this way; not a wash, just exactly the tones as they are supposed to be … but with such power that after 1 min I had to stop it in fear of forever ruining my reputation as good neighbor.  This is going to be tricky … I’m going to need to spy on my neighbours to find out when they are not home so I can fully enjoy my setup.

 

“Miles Davis: Ascenceur pour l’échafaud” soundtrack (CD & Rdio)

 

I have listened to this music for such a long time on various formats (tape, CD, streaming), so I figured this would be a good test case.

 

The first thing that was obvious was the hiss in the 1998 CD release of the 1958 recording.  I never noticed this before, not that I was paying attention to it, but this is a testament to the quality of the speakers that I can notice it.  On the re-mastered version, which was available on Rdio, the hiss was absent as expected, however I did notice a bit of gating (is that the correct term?).  Basically I felt that the removal of the noise signature took a little away from the original elements, especially noticeable on the tenor sax.  But this was very slight and obviously has nothing to do with the speakers, but the mastering itself.  What a wonderful experience to listen to this piece on these speakers.  After twiddling around with the different modes of the receiver, I stopped on the Dolby Pro Logic IIz – Height setting, since it seem to provide more ‘presence’ … the effect of which gave the impression of having the musicians in the room with me.  For the first time I was aware of each individual player with all there expressiveness.  This was absolutely clear when I could hear each individual brush stroke on the snare and the subtle accents.  It gave me a whole new appreciation of the musicianship and the timeless quality of this recording.   For those of you thinking of getting the R50s to enhance your sound, I strongly recommend it as it gives more breadth and more frontal power, which enhance the illusion of having the musicians there with you.

 

Actually I'd like to know what do you guys recommend as audio mode when listening to music ?



""Gyorgy Ligeti"" – Continuum / Atmospheres / Ramifications

 

There are recordings that just beg for a multi channel aural space, anything by Gyorgy Ligeti for instance.  For those not familiar with this composer, just think of any memorable moment in a Stanley Kubrick film and chances are it’s enhanced by music by Ligeti.  It’s a music that requires precise speakers, because his compositions often play with rhythmic layers that create phasing, where every note is important.  If the sound is muddled, the effect is lost.  The KEF speakers render these effects perfectly, since again, the individual voices can clearly be heard.

 

Everything I put through it (Jazz, Rock, Folk, Classical, Electronic) sounded phenomenal to me. I never thought that surrounding myself with sound would be so pleasant, but also heighten my awareness of the musicianship by hearing very precisely the contribution of each player.  This was only made possible because of the dynamics and accurateness of these R-Series speakers.

 

 

Movies & TV:

 

I have very few 7.1 mixed films in my collection, as I tend to purchase more foreign classics in ‘full glorious mono’ (as a friend would put it), but I did have ""Prometheus"" by Ridley Scott, which I used to test out the speakers.  Right from the start, with the rolling military snare drums of the 20th Century Fox Fanfare and thunderous thump of the bass drum, I was transported into the theater.  In the introductory scene, there is a waterfall … the roar of it was quite phenomenal and then a massive alien ship hovers into the frame with substantial low tones passing overhead.  In the past, I’ve had systems that could deliver a good rumble to the room, but this is the first time I can say I could distinguish the tones of these two low hums … and even though there was absolutely no denying the power of these tones, I didn’t feel that it was simply just making the walls shake … it was clearly connected to what I was seeing on screen and totally engulfed me into the experience of being there.  Granted, this has to do with good sound design, but I think I would not have gotten this if it weren’t for these speakers.  With regards to the R50s, I have the impression they were also quite active during this sequence, because I did have the impression that the low tones of the ship were coming somewhat above me (though I realise that probably all speakers are involved to achieve this specialization).

 

I’ve also been listening lately to the Daredevil series on Netflix.  Having a Roku, I do get the Dolby Digital + mix.  In light of the fact that this character is blind and has an enhanced auditory sense, the sound mix is used quite effectively to convey this ability, especially during fight sequences.  All the thumps and positioning effects are quite vivid with these speakers and dialogue very clear in the center channel.

 

Sincerely, KEF literally brought the theater into my home and now I understand why you guys (Braden & Ara) sometime say how much nicer it is to have this experience in your own home.  As you often pointed out, the speakers make all the difference … and now I fully agree, speakers should be the number one priority of any enthusiast.

 

When I’ll have the budget for it (in the new year), I will get a full blown Atmos enabled receiver and let you guys know of my impressions.  For now I’ll just be enjoying the speakers thoroughly on a daily basis.

 

Thank you HTGuys and KEF… you rocked my world!

 

Now for the tricky part: Avoiding Eviction.

 

Off to watch some HDTV.

110,1199,Earpads are of low quality,"Pros: They sound good

Cons: The earpads break apart and expose the foam inside, evan after minor use. I'm on my third pair. The worst part is that KEF doesn't offer any replacement pads on their site anymore, so now I am stuck with a pair of expensive headphones that look cheap as hell. 

Can't recommend. ",N

As an owner of the T305 and X300AW systems, I was familiar with KEF's commitment to high quality design and uncompromising sound.  My dilemma was whether to purchase the LS50 or KEF R300.  I made the right choice.  With the additional bass drivers and accompanying fuller sound, these speakers were all I needed to satisfy my ears and complete my system.  Thank you, KEF for your continuing legacy of excellence.  I am a customer for life!",P
117,1343,KEF M400,Everything I expected. Lightweight and good for travel. Constructed well. Blue color looks great. I rated sound quality  a 5 but I'm comparing to my last headphones which were at a much lower price point and certainly do not measure up to the KEF M400. Overall I am extremely happy with the purchase and would recommend,P
124,1179,Great compliment  to my KEF bookshelf speakers,"I had been looking to provide a fuller sound for the room and did not want to purchase a full size speaker, instead I decided to add the E301 speakers and stands to achieve the great sound quality that KEF is known for. Very happy with them and would highly recommend. ",P

137,1199,Longest lasting headphones I've owned,"I've had these headphones for 2 years and I travel with them everywhere. I also work out in them, though my head is a bit smalla nd they tend to slip off on occassion. Still i think its my head size. Anyway, they have held up amazingly well for being thrown in my bag. I should be using the case included but sometimes its too big to fit in my carry-on luggage + computer.

I'm bummed that now theres a black / black pair... I'd love to trade up. Hint Hint KEF!

140,1199,KEF M500 is an excellent choice for balanced listenng,"My second set for this model. Comfortable and well made.

141,1203,KEF X300WA,"Was trying out another set of Speakers the ones with Bamboo finish plus a DAC before my trial  period ended I saw these on sale both at Amazon/KEFdirect. when I calculated the costs between the two system it was nearly the same So I got them from Amazon/Kefdirect on sale. 
Some observation 
1. ) set them up using your iphone for wireless it seems easier, my new mini Mac and Time Capsule are within 3 feet of the unit so have no issues with connectivity sound quality on the wireless is very very good. 2.)  if you mess up with connectivity on wireless system (due to software upgrade ) I called KEF  and was told to power off everything wait for 60 min.s and start afresh that worked ! 3.) Sound quality ?
 I am still breaking them in but they do sound with more clarity than the other Bamboo system 4.) when I add up the costs of the 4 amplifiers plus 2 high quality DAC's at the sale price with a  name  like KEF this is certainly a very good value ! now I need to go an audition the LS 50 ! ",P
144,1163,Great upgrade from my Klipsch Bookshelves,I was previously running some Klipsch Icon Speakers for my bookshelves.

152,1355,Fanfreakentastic!,"Long ago, when I was young, my Dad and I auditioned new speakers to go along with his Macintosh gear we settled on up picking the 104.2's which were simply amazing at the time and award winning to boot. Now I needed to upgrade my speakers but I was quite nervous about it as I already had a nice combination of gear and speakers. I was walking by KEF at a trade show looked over to what I was hearing and literally doubled back and did a double take. I couldn't believe the sound I heard from the LS50’s. It was so memorable I remembered the sound in my head and purchased the speakers a year later. After breaking them in I can't be happier, the imaging is amazing and the midrange, which is so hard to get right it fantastic. I was also really surprised by the low frequency extension, simply amazing for a speaker with a 5.25"" low/mid driver and no DSP. I have had over thirty people in ""The Chair"" and all end up with their jaws on the floor in disbelief while I'm grinning from ear to ear, anticipating when the parties over so I can sit and listen. KEF HIT IT OUT OF THE PARK with these speakers. An unbelievable value! Take the time to break them in (100 hours or better) and you will be blown away. Oh and I have been in the audio business for twenty-five years and am a musician so listening to music and creating music is pretty much all I do. One last thing, I am also into Hi-Res audio among other forms or audio and I was super happy that the LS50’s extend to 40KHz which so happens to meet the JAS Hi-Res standard. ",P
153,1355,Landmark Purchase!,"The LS50s are simply some of the finest bookshelf/stand-mount speakers I have ever heard. I've heard comparative offerings from most of the major players (and some of the smaller ones) and while many models have their redeeming qualities, these babies just flat out sing like nothing else.

It's remarkable - when dialed in right, and fed/driven by qualified gear, they actually disappear from the room and the only thing left is just you and the music. It seems like such a simple thing, but until you actually experience it, descriptions pale in comparison.

In a nutshell, when these things are at their best they perform on such a high level it's ridiculous. 

Two things to note, for potential buyers:

1) 8 ohms seems a bit optimistic. Measured performance, averaged out, is probably more like 6 ohms (and as low as 4 - per Stereophile). Just be sure your amplifier is up to the task. My Parasound A21 has no trouble at all but does run a bit warmer than with some B & W's.

2) They are indeed a little less sensitive than some others, but don't let that dissuade you. Just be mindful of it.

3) The bass these produce is incredible. It's more than enough for my oddly shaped 9x20x10 room (and my neighbors). If you have a large room and/or just like a lot of presence with the lowest octave then you'll want a sub.


The better the gear you can throw at these the better they will perform. I am currently in awe of how awesome they are and how luck I am to own them.


If you're reading these reviews, just do yourself a solid and pick up a pair. Try to buy from your local dealer if at all possible. Often they'll work with you, and supporting your community is more important now than ever!

The LS50s will add joy to your life. And in the end, joy is what this is all about.

154,1355,Works fine with low-powered tubes!,"A local dealer made me an offer I couldn't refuse, so I bought these speakers without having an opportunity to audition them. I was a bit uncertain because the specs indicate that the LS50s require some power, and my (restored) Fisher 400 tube receiver is rated at about 28 wpc. 

I had nothing to worry about; the Fisher has plenty of juice to get the LS50s singing in my little 9 x 12 listening room. Compared to my previous speakers (rated at 90dB efficiency vs. the KEF's 86dB efficiency), I only have to notch up the volume knob slightly higher to achieve the same level.

My conclusion is the quality of the power source is more important to the LS50s than the amp's nominal rating; the transformers on the Fisher 400 are pretty beefy. ",P
155,1355,Excellent workmanship and service,"I've had KEF (3005s) as my original HT system for several years in my den and am very happy with them; but I always wanted a set of stereo speakers for my living room for those cozy fireplace moments. I tested number of speakers including dynaudio, B&W, MAs and several others. The LS50 blew them all away in terms of sound stage and clarity. Currently powering them with an emotiva xpa-200 amp and their new dc-1 DAC. I listen to mostly digital music and these sound awesome in this combination! Thanks for making my holiday season even greater.",P
156,1355,LS50= Unparalled excellence,"Speakers: LS50 (2.1 with Velodyne 8"" SW) 
AV receiver: Marantz SR6008

Let me run down how this search began by saying few words: I was looking for an under 3000 dollar system for my room of 12'X10' room. I initially was thinking of 5.1 HT system but found out soon that it was a great compromise on quality ( systems tested: BW CM1/CM5 + 683; Def tech (bipolars). I heard kef for the first time when my brother happened to get R100s (in UK) and he was very very happy with them (stereo set up). That prompted me to research on this and initially thought of Q900 and Q700 (not Q500- bad review or no good reviews). I soon realized that large speakers might be too large for my room size. And then began looking for R100 series; with excellent reviews I almost wanted to buy them but luckily were not available in texas or in KefDirect store. That prompted be to look for LS50; and the more I knew about them, I got more excited about these. When I called one of the kef dealers in Dallas, he said "" LS50 are the reason for us to start selling KEF and we are very pleased with performance"" . I took a gamble and got them finally after few hiccups with ordering process (minor). 

I am not an audiophile by any standard but I can certainly appreciate fine music and this is a very brief summary of what i think
Built: Clean; classy; and Beautiful (All the people who walked in the room- first word- they look nice), heavy
Performance: This must be one of the purchases that I made ( a costly one relatively) where I feel that this is indeeed WORTH every penny. The sound is amazing in all standard. The treble is a world apart ( i personally feel BMW 600 or CM series cannot match the quality of the it and I am myself surprised to see the quality of sound that comes out from these speakers. The depth of sound produced is mind boggling in literal sense. More i listen these are getting more better. they do have Great Mids and a fantastic woofer ( although I must say, for my room a woofer makes music Complete). I placed these beauties 2.5 mtrs apart secondary to room restrictions at 10 inches about my ear level)
Connection time/ process: EASY

I am very happy customer currently and I do not regret my purchase and Infact I would highly recommend this product to anyone who really wants to enjoy a clean and in depth and most importantly non fatiguing music and even more importantly very beautiful looking speakers. 

Great Job Kef and Now you have a new fan",P
157,1355,Highly Recommended,"I listened to some KEF floorstanding reference speakers about 10 years at a speaker boutique and got hooked on high end audio. Unfortunately, I've always been buying speakers on the affordable end of the audiophile spectrum and constantly bitten by the upgrade bug as a result. These speakers are about twice as expensive as any that I have previously owned but they deliver far above their price range.Perhaps my favorite feature is their ability to play perfectly (to my ears) when off axis. I don't have a dedicated listening room, so it has been common for the best listening position to be some spot standing in the middle of the room. Now, I can fully enjoy my music from anywhere in the room. Upgrade bug officially squashed.

FYI - I mostly listen to classic and indie rock. Power with an Exposure amp and a Centrance DAC with all-digital sources.",P
158,1355,Giant Killers - Can't Be Beaten for Less than 5-10x The Price,"I was stunned that all the reviews were right about these fantastic speakers - they truly are Giant Killers, especially for their price.

They're beautiful and their sound qualities are just as amazing - when set up correctly. They do require special care in set up to sound up to their potential. Any critical comments you may have seen, likely result from improper set up. 

To sound their best, they must be placed out in the room, away from the walls, and with their ports fully open. In that configuration they really do disappear in a wall of lifelike sound, with a great soundstage and imaging. 

Of course their other sound qualities are superior as well - great bass, mids, highs, tone, tenure, texture, timbre - very real, lifelike sound, without any boxy constraints. 

They really do have bass, despite their specs - though, if you're a HT, or car audio buff, who loves inaccurate, boomy sound, you may be disappointed. I'm using the R400b with them, but they really don't need it, except for the very lowest notes.

They also require a powerful amp with high current output - 200+ w per channel into 8ohms. They're fairly inefficient. 

And... I'm using them with the DSP Anti-mode 2.0 to eliminate the ""room boom"" - especially with a sub. Makes integrating a sub a ""piece of cake."" And... provides a very good pre-amp, as well. Add a tube buffer, as I have, and the sound doesn't get much better. 

A great source, such as a great SACD player with XLR cables makes everything even better!

Do yourself a favor... and get a pair of these... unless ""you have money to burn,"" and can spend $50K on your system, which is what it will take to better them.",P
159,1355,It's all true~!,"Even with very little break-in, I can tell you that John Atkinson in Stereophile was absolutely correct: Class A for smaller rooms. Also, read the What HiFi review.

172,1144,Giant Killers - Can't Be Beaten for Less than 5-10x The Price,"I was stunned that all the reviews were right about these fantastic speakers - they truly are Giant Killers, especially for their price.

They're beautiful and their sound qualities are just as amazing - when set up correctly. They do require special care in set up to sound up to their potential. Any critical comments you may have seen, likely result from improper set up. 

To sound their best, they must be placed out in the room, away from the walls, and with their ports fully open. In that configuration they really do disappear in a wall of lifelike sound, with a great soundstage and imaging. 

Of course their other sound qualities are superior as well - great bass, mids, highs, tone, tenure, texture, timbre - very real, lifelike sound, without any boxy constraints. 

They really do have bass, despite their specs - though, if you're a HT, or car audio buff, who loves inaccurate, boomy sound, you may be disappointed. I'm using the R400b with them, but they really don't need it, except for the very lowest notes.

They also require a powerful amp with high current output - 200+ w per channel into 8ohms. They're fairly inefficient. 

And... I'm using them with the DSP Anti-mode 2.0 to eliminate the ""room boom"" - especially with a sub. Makes integrating a sub a ""piece of cake."" And... provides a very good pre-amp, as well. Add a tube buffer, as I have, and the sound doesn't get much better. 

A great source, such as a great SACD player with XLR cables makes everything even better!

Do yourself a favor... and get a pair of these... unless ""you have money to burn,"" and can spend $50K on your system, which is what it will take to better them.",P
173,1144,Highly Recommended,"I listened to some KEF floorstanding reference speakers about 10 years at a speaker boutique and got hooked on high end audio. Unfortunately, I've always been buying speakers on the affordable end of the audiophile spectrum and constantly bitten by the upgrade bug as a result. These speakers are about twice as expensive as any that I have previously owned but they deliver far above their price range.Perhaps my favorite feature is their ability to play perfectly (to my ears) when off axis. I don't have a dedicated listening room, so it has been common for the best listening position to be some spot standing in the middle of the room. Now, I can fully enjoy my music from anywhere in the room. Upgrade bug officially squashed.

FYI - I mostly listen to classic and indie rock. Power with an Exposure amp and a Centrance DAC with all-digital sources. ",P
174,1144,LS50= Unparalled,"Speakers: LS50 (2.1 with Velodyne 8"" SW) 
AV receiver: Marantz SR6008

Let me run down how this search began by saying few words: I was looking for an under 3000 dollar system for my room of 12'X10' room. I initially was thinking of 5.1 HT system but found out soon that it was a great compromise on quality ( systems tested: BW CM1/CM5 + 683; Def tech (bipolars). I heard kef for the first time when my brother happened to get R100s (in UK) and he was very very happy with them (stereo set up). That prompted me to research on this and initially thought of Q900 and Q700 (not Q500- bad review or no good reviews). I soon realized that large speakers might be too large for my room size. And then began looking for R100 series; with excellent reviews I almost wanted to buy them but luckily were not available in texas or in KefDirect store. That prompted be to look for LS50; and the more I knew about them, I got more excited about these. When I called one of the kef dealers in Dallas, he said "" LS50 are the reason for us to start selling KEF and we are very pleased with performance"" . I took a gamble and got them finally after few hiccups with ordering process (minor). 

I am not an audiophile by any standard but I can certainly appreciate fine music and this is a very brief summary of what i think
Built: Clean; classy; and Beautiful (All the people who walked in the room- first word- they look nice), heavy
Performance: This must be one of the purchases that I made ( a costly one relatively) where I feel that this is indeeed WORTH every penny. The sound is amazing in all standard. The treble is a world apart ( i personally feel BMW 600 or CM series cannot match the quality of the it and I am myself surprised to see the quality of sound that comes out from these speakers. The depth of sound produced is mind boggling in literal sense. More i listen these are getting more better. they do have Great Mids and a fantastic woofer ( although I must say, for my room a woofer makes music Complete). I placed these beauties 2.5 mtrs apart secondary to room restrictions at 10 inches about my ear level)
Connection time/ process: EASY

I am very happy customer currently and I do not regret my purchase and Infact I would highly recommend this product to anyone who really wants to enjoy a clean and in depth and most importantly non fatiguing music and even more importantly very beautiful looking speakers. 

Great Job Kef and Now you have a new fan",P
175,1144,Excellent workmanship and service,"I've had KEF (3005s) as my original HT system for several years in my den and am very happy with them; but I always wanted a set of stereo speakers for my living room for those cozy fireplace moments. I tested number of speakers including dynaudio, B&W, MAs and several others. The LS50 blew them all away in terms of sound stage and clarity. Currently powering them with an emotiva xpa-200 amp and their new dc-1 DAC. I listen to mostly digital music and these sound awesome in this combination! Thanks for making my holiday season even greater. ",P
176,1144,Works fine with low-powered tubes!,"A local dealer made me an offer I couldn't refuse, so I bought these speakers without having an opportunity to audition them. I was a bit uncertain because the specs indicate that the LS50s require some power, and my (restored) Fisher 400 tube receiver is rated at about 28 wpc. 

I had nothing to worry about; the Fisher has plenty of juice to get the LS50s singing in my little 9 x 12 listening room. Compared to my previous speakers (rated at 90dB efficiency vs. the KEF's 86dB efficiency), I only have to notch up the volume knob slightly higher to achieve the same level.

My conclusion is the quality of the power source is more important to the LS50s than the amp's nominal rating; the transformers on the Fisher 400 are pretty beefy.",P
177,1144,Landmark Purchase!,"The LS50s are simply some of the finest bookshelf/stand-mount speakers I have ever heard. I've heard comparative offerings from most of the major players (and some of the smaller ones) and while many models have their redeeming qualities, these babies just flat out sing like nothing else.

It's remarkable - when dialed in right, and fed/driven by qualified gear, they actually disappear from the room and the only thing left is just you and the music. It seems like such a simple thing, but until you actually experience it, descriptions pale in comparison.

In a nutshell, when these things are at their best they perform on such a high level it's ridiculous. 

Two things to note, for potential buyers:

1) 8 ohms seems a bit optimistic. Measured performance, averaged out, is probably more like 6 ohms (and as low as 4 - per Stereophile). Just be sure your amplifier is up to the task. My Parasound A21 has no trouble at all but does run a bit warmer than with some B & W's.

2) They are indeed a little less sensitive than some others, but don't let that dissuade you. Just be mindful of it.

3) The bass these produce is incredible. It's more than enough for my oddly shaped 9x20x10 room (and my neighbors). If you have a large room and/or just like a lot of presence with the lowest octave then you'll want a sub.


The better the gear you can throw at these the better they will perform. I am currently in awe of how awesome they are and how luck I am to own them.


If you're reading these reviews, just do yourself a solid and pick up a pair. Try to buy from your local dealer if at all possible. Often they'll work with you, and supporting your community is more important now than ever!

The LS50s will add joy to your life. And in the end, joy is what this is all about.",P
178,1144,Fanfreakentastic!,"Long ago, when I was young, my Dad and I auditioned new speakers to go along with his Macintosh gear we settled on up picking the 104.2's which were simply amazing at the time and award winning to boot. Now I needed to upgrade my speakers but I was quite nervous about it as I already had a nice combination of gear and speakers. I was walking by KEF at a trade show looked over to what I was hearing and literally doubled back and did a double take. I couldn't believe the sound I heard from the LS50’s. It was so memorable I remembered the sound in my head and purchased the speakers a year later. After breaking them in I can't be happier, the imaging is amazing and the midrange, which is so hard to get right it fantastic. I was also really surprised by the low frequency extension, simply amazing for a speaker with a 5.25"" low/mid driver and no DSP. I have had over thirty people in ""The Chair"" and all end up with their jaws on the floor in disbelief while I'm grinning from ear to ear, anticipating when the parties over so I can sit and listen. KEF HIT IT OUT OF THE PARK with these speakers. An unbelievable value! Take the time to break them in (100 hours or better) and you will be blown away. Oh and I have been in the audio business for twenty-five years and am a musician so listening to music and creating music is pretty much all I do. One last thing, I am also into Hi-Res audio among other forms or audio and I was super happy that the LS50’s extend to 40KHz which so happens to meet the JAS Hi-Res standard. ",P
179,1144,Fantastic Product!!!,"Wow... KEF really did an amazing job building the LS50's! From sound, build, design and even the insignificant features such as good looks... it does it all! I'd like to thank the amazing service KEF offers and once again thank them for making such a beautiful sounding product! ",P
180,1144,The Nike of loudspeakers,Wider area great fantastic love these little diamonds well done kef now stop production I want to be the only one to own these,P
184,1151,Solid performance in a classic style,"I had my eye on the R300  based upon myriad good reviews. Finding a local retailer through KEF's website I went to audition those, but they had sold the last in stock. Instead they said they would tailor the sound of the R500 which they did have to closely mimic R300. The shop was apparently not good at disguising the incredible range of the R500, and I was taken by the R500's abilities to deliver the smoothest transitions from mid-range to highs with aplomb. I auditioned two other close competitors that day, only to find that while close in price they could not compete with the overall value of smooth midrange, bright yet not overpowering highs and deep tight bass that the R500 delivers. And they are now mine!

My journey to choose KEF spanned 26 years. I had auditioned one of the first versions of the Uni-Q when I bought my first hi-fi set of components in 1989. While they were leagues above in performance to others I'd auditioned even then, raising a young family meant I had to compromise. Now able to get what my ears deserve, the R500 (and R200C) give me boundless joy as I head toward retirement.",P

191,1253,Great upgrade from my Klipsch Bookshelves,I was previously running some Klipsch Icon Speakers for my bookshelves. They really felt shallow and definitely didn't make their presence known so to speak. The Q100s on the other hand provide wonderful surround sound. I could not be happier with these especially while getting them at an incredible price!,P
192,1253,Excellent Imaging,"I am impressed by the imaging capability of the Q100 speakers. Especially for a classic recording, you can locate every single instrument in an orchestra. ",P
193,1253,Awesome speaker,"These speakers sound great. If I did not know any better I would swear I was running them with a sub..but my vintage Harman Kardon 330c receiver that I have them connected to, does not have a sub out. :-). The Uni-Q driver is impressive.",P
194,1253,Great Speakers,These are my first pair of Kef's and I am impressed! I intended to use them fronts and rears for a 5.1 surround but I was so blown away that I bought the Q500's for the fronts! I am satisfied with my purchase and would recommend to anyone looking for an entry level setup that sounds awesome!,P
205,1143,Something Special,Absolutely amazing sound right out of the box with my Marantz SR7008. . Play loud and quiet equally well. The amount of bass was a pleasant surprise for my ear. I absolutely the love the Racing Red colour. Well done KEF.,P
222,1162,Great Monitor for the money,"This speaker wowed me, even more so than the beloved LS50 which I own, both speakers having great detail and excellent midrange and liquid cool sounding highs... For the money I was blown away on how KEF trickle down technology has made it into some of their less expensive lines. Not to take away from the LS50 where it shine is in overall balance, I am extremely happy with these speakers so much so I might get another pair. ",P
225,1143,Amazing speaker - could not be happier to have them in my home,Almost as beautiful to look at as they are to listen to...  Amazing speakers - could not be happier with them.,P

234,1163,Completed my Q series home theater,"I used these for my rear surrounds.  Now my 7.1 is completed.  With the exception of my subwoofer, all my speakers are now KEF.  I love the sound of my home theater and highly recommend these.",P
238,1355,Recommended,Little loud speaker!,A
239,1159,Most incredible sound in Hi-Fi,"I bought the Q90 speakers in 1991. They sounded better than some of the $5k speakers I compared them to. They are still sounding perfect. I cannot imagine how good the newer series sounds. Doesn't matter how loud I turn up the volume on my Denon receiver (and CD/iPod player), there is absolutely no distortion. When there is no music, there is absolute silence, no hiss like many other speakers produce. I sit in front of these Q90s and it's like I am on stage with every single note and instrument being able to be heard individually, clearly, precisely. So one cannot go wrong with the KEF Q series. They will last forever. I might have to try to sell mine and upgrade to the Q900s, but I cannot imagine that they would sound any better, because the Q90s sound perfect already.",P
240,1143,Its all true,"Everything you have read, all the review are accurate and completely true.  Everything you would ever want in a mini speaker. Nothing but the best.",P
241,1199,Most Comfortable Headphones,Excellent product with great customer service.,P
242,1143,Near Field Set Up is Perfect,"These little KEF's are being used in a near field set up in my office, run off an iMac and NAD D3020.   They are still being burnt in (around 50 hours use so far) but image and presentation is all I had hoped for.   I have them placed on a pair of IsoAccoustics stands on my desktop either side of my iMac.  The desk is in the open so the speakers are not anywhere near a wall either to the side or rear.  
Some consider the NAD to be too small to run the KEF's, but they do sound very good to my ears.  I believe the speakers will respond well to both the modest NAD as well much higher powered amps.  I had listened to the KEF's at a dealer in the past, but was not immediately impressed; but I knew they had more to offer than the poor set up in Europe while I was vacationing.   
Probably one of the most satisfying buys I have made in the audio field in my 40 years of experimentation.  I am very glad I finally took the plunge.",P
243,1209,Excellent buy,All my other speakers are KEF and I did not want to be disappointed if I bought something else for the kitchen ceiling speaker. It fills in the sound very well and I get a good mix with my Q700 towers and subwoofer providing more bass.,P
244,1163,Great Speakers at a Great price,I just purchased a pair of the KEF Q100 speakers during their Black Friday Sale. Love them!,P
245,1143,Kef LS 50,"I had recently purchased  Kef X300AW for my computer  speakers I liked them so much that I decided to purchase the LS 50 for my Dad ! To replace his 15 year old energy C8 . The thought being if we did not like the sound in the living room these speakers would be relegated to  the bedroom! We put them on old Sanus 28"" stands about 18"" from the back wall . The thought of relegating the LS 50 lasted about 15 seconds in a room that is atleast 15' by 24' the loudness surprised us running with a high end marantz receiver . Thus they replaced the old Energy C8 for good . The LS 50 look good on stands and sound just perfect for older ears  as per my Dad 
The sound is clear crisp and spacious , have a sub woofer connected to it but we really don't need it with unit it seems to have just the right amount of Bass ! ",P
249,1201,Fantastic,This is a great affordable solution to Hi-Fi.  The build quality and sound are everything I hoped for.  Highly recommended!,P
250,1342,M 100 Ear  Headphones,"My take on  the M 100 ear headphones Well I got these since I purchased  a pair of  KEF LS 50  for my Dad who retired  his 15 years old Energy C-8's  and KEF had promotion I took advantage of the promotion. Build Quality is very good except that  the wires at connection ends seem to be pretty ""fragile"" if one accidentally pulls them they just might come loose or break. The Sound quality I would give it a 4 star rating  the ear buds fit very well and do seal outside sound for most part . One does need to  break these in by playing them for a couple of days .  Also I must say that  having bought 3 different products from KEF  Direct  in less than 3 months I found   the company to be very responsive to any questions or issues I have had, specially Anthony in tech support and Dan in Internet sales ! they are very prompt in calling back .",A
252,1231,Best hardware buy I have made in years.,"These speakers are a perfect match for my Nad D 3020 and iMac 27"" Retina. I have been smiling since I installed them. Highly recommended. ",P

254,1143,HiFi that's easy to live with...,"The little LS50 that can! My local HiFi rep wouldn't even let me audition these once I told him I listen mostly to Metal. Since then, I have read many reviews and all point to this being an amazing speaker set. I purchased these from KEF Direct for my family room as a second 2 channel system. Paired with a nice sub-woofer, these compact monitors deliver the goods (detail, dynamics, imaging and presence).  I'm finding more enjoyment in the presentation of recordings I am very familiar. With some older recordings, I am amazed at how well they were processed back in the day. My older speakers were hiding much of the studio sound and engineering enhancements. As many have said in the past... you will rediscover your music library with these gems.
Easy to live with... the WAF is off the chart!",P
255,1231,Works great with my Rega Brio,A great complement to hear the detail of how KEF builds around the sound.,P
256,1396,Def reco top quality sound for a Bargain price,I'm a big KEF fan. None of the competition can match their quality in the same price range. If you're looking for raw power and not Hi Fidelity sound you should look somewhere else. I think the center speaker provides clear sound for both music and movies. Made a big difference on the scenes with conversations. I have two Martin Logan's as front speakers and this unit can deliver on par (if not better) performance on the high and mid tones. Very satisfied with the purchase. Not a big fan of the color though.,P
257,1231,Great value,"It is pretty hard to believe this is a hundred dollar a pair set of speakers. When they are pushed hard to the 100 watt max they struggle a bit, but at even moderately loud volume they are fantastic. ",P
258,1350,EGGS,Small speaker that delivers!!,P
259,1396,Excellent,Great service. Fills out the sound of my bookshelf speakers,P
260,1234,Very nice sounding speaker,"I got these for $299.98/pr on the 12 days of Christmas sale. I use them strictly for music in a 2 channel system. Bass is strong and punchy without being overblown, the midrange is sweet but the treble is rolled off slightly. Although If a speaker is to commit a sin in the treble region, I much prefer it to be rolled off than over powering as too many speakers seem to be these days. Overall a good speaker but not quite as amazing as the Q100's that I also own. A steal at the price I paid, but at the regular price of $900/pair I would probably cough up the extra $200 and get the Q500's. 
Both of the grilles  were bowed out slightly, I emailed Kef direct and they sent a new pair of grilles out the same day. Excellant customer service.",P
261,1396,I Love it,Beautifully constructed speaker with fabulous sound.  I purchased it to replace an existing center speaker with a resonance problem. Problem solved.,P
262,1396,"Great quality, great sound.","Adds great sound to room. Paired with Kef floorstanding speakers, happy with the setup.",P
263,1153,Exceeded my expectations in every way!,"I've had my eye on these for some time now as I continue to build my KEF R Series system. Out of the box they look immaculate. Nice, heavy, solid construction, and I love the gloss black finish. I can't stop staring at them. My wife is getting annoyed! This R100 pair replaced the KEF Compact Q Series speakers I've been using for surrounds for the last 10 or so years. I thought those sounded great. The R100s are a huge step up and truly knocked it out of the park for me. Thank you KEF!",P
264,1355,Worth every penny....and then some,"Every bit as good as advertised....and the LE colors are just icing on the cake.  If you like one of the standard finishes these can usually be found for ~1199 at various dealers, and at that price they're an absolute steal.

Modern aesthetics
Excellent build quality
Unparalleled sound in this segment, both size and budget

If you give these the proper treatment, you'll be happy for a long time.  Personally using a Matte Black/Blue LE pair matched with a Schiit Gumby/Ragnarok combo, which is also in black.  Simply amazing sound, and not too bad on the eyes either.

**Also wanted to briefly comment on Kef Direct and their service.  I was originally sent a pair in the classic piano black finish by mistake.  Made a quick phone call and Dan took care of everything with no hassle whatsoever.  Top shelf product, and top shelf service.    ",P
265,1153,Tube lovers must have a listen,"As with any mini-monitor, the low bass extension below 80Hz falls off quickly. This makes these appropriate for surround speakers in a HT setup, tube amp listening or integration with a good sub-woofer. I am currently using these in a powerful system with two 12"" ported sub-woofers. As long as I keep the volume in control, these speakers integrate nicely to fill out a moderately sized listening room. The subs are crossed at 40Hz using a second order slope. With the room gain and running the speakers full range, the sound is very fulfilling. 
I have experimented with the port foam plugs but have found the best sound control in the lower register to be with the port open. Restricting it or plugging it with the foam only reduced the ability of the system (box and port) to control the woofer excursion.
This is a fun little speaker with many possible uses. The fit and finish are impeccable. The sound is very close to the LS50... as many forum users have asked. If money is an issue, the Q100 sounds very nice as well.",P
266,1355,Awesome,Best bang for your buck out there!,P
267,1264,Awesome Performance,"I love the sound produced by KEF T105 model speakers. I was very skeptic about performance based on Size of speakers. Once i observed the sound generated wow output  is cool.Woofer is really good.
It looks really cool in Home theater setup as they are slick and perfect fit for Medium sized Home theater rooms. ",P
268,1143,Better then imagined!,"Just getting back into hifi and bought a Arcam A19 with CD17 then these little beauties ""LS50"". They sound good out the box but after 60 + hours they sound excellent. Very clear, good lows and looks are top notch. Great job on these speakers!",P
269,1143,Best sound in the world in compact nearfeild monitor,"Fantastic sound and immense sound stage are a hallmark trait of these speakers. One of the best values in compact speakers that I know of in the world that IMHO I know of. Best with reference quality equipment placed upstream.  Still somewhat forgiving when used with midrange quality, but will only reveal a portion of what they are capable. I have owned these for several years now and still enjoy that at least as much as the 1st day I set them up. Even though I owned other world class efforts in the low to medium price ranges.....*under 3k a pair' I would always would come back to these. Best for small rooms in a near field environment( my room is only about 800 cubic feet) It is no wonder it is such a valuable tool for recording engineers. Having heard Spendor, Harbeth and the original LS 3/5 A, this speaker retains all of the legacy of those designs but improves on them in EVERY conceivable way. I feel it would take Headphones at or near the price to equal them as well as speakers costing 10 times their modest asking price. This IMHO is a landmark achievement that will take decades to improve on.  All but the extreme low bass is reproduce with speed and finesse that equals the finest electrostatic designs to date. If you are considering ANY speaker at double the price and don't need room rattling bass below 40 hz or output levels above moderate listening levels, these are a set you can easily grow into. Highly recommended in any rig from 3k-30k+. Warning.....do NOT be surprised if the sound leads you to investigating the capability of the Blade, or Reference series....which is a no brainer for larger spaces.  R series are great too for slightly less investment.  Pound for pound these are the hands down best buy period for a smaller to mid size (under 1500 cubic ft) room. These ARE as good as it gets. ",P
270,1231,Another great product,"Got these for my son, he is very pleased with the product.  I have had KEF speakers for years, great sounding products, exceptional value",P
271,1143,Very satisfied,"I came into this not really knowing anything. I am just a regular person new to Hi-Fi. That being said, after many days of research I ended up getting these wonderful speakers powered by a Peachtree 220se. I was close to buying a sub-woofer, but was pleasantly surprised they didn't really need them. I feel as though the bass on these speakers were more than adequate for my taste and adding a sub would not do them justice. 

I can't express how overjoyed with these speakers. I'm happily listening to all my music over again for the first time. ",P
272,1264,Impressive,"Honestly I did not know what to expect from these speakers given the unique slim driver etc. But the sound is amazing for their size. There is a slight break-in period, but once they are off and running the sound is crisp and clear. ",P
273,1144,Great Music and Home Theater Speaker,"I am not an audiophile expert but I do enjoy great music sound and accurate sound from my home theater system.  I have a simple home theater consisting of a Marantz 1604 and a Samsung UHD Television.  For speakers I have KEF LS50 speakers for both front left and right and center channels and in the rear I have very basic Infinity Primus 163 and an old JBL 12 400w sub.  So, my system is probably simpler (less expensive) that most on this site.  Now, the addition of the KEF LS50 speakers made this mediocre surround system come alive and sound like a very expensive system.  The room measures about 20'x30' has a rug and curtains in the rear and the KEFLS50 speakers more than fill this room with sound.  I enjoy speakers that are slightly bright but also carry a full range of sound.  I was surprised how crisp the highs on the LS50 are and amazed at how much bass response these speakers provide.   The build quality of these speakers are rock solid and they look beautiful.  As for a center channel, the single LS50 reproduces the human voice very well, it is clear (not muffled) but sill allows the lower ranges of voices to be heard clearly.  As left and right home theater speakers, the LS50's pick up the details of bullet casings dropping to the floor in movies as well as the sound of Mick Jagger's pick on his guitar during the soulful blues song, Love In Vain.  

I am not running a high powered system, I do not have a super sophisticated set up, but the KEF LS50's deliver a sound stage that rivals many of the best systems out there.  If you like a speaker that is a little bright at the high end and faithfully reproduces bass at the lower end, you will love the KEFLS50's for music and a front home theater stage.",P
275,1355,Fantastic,"I have these lovely special editions set up as near field monitors, and the soundstage is nothing short of amazing.  they are being driven by a Rogue Cronus Mag II which has more than enough headroom to drive these speakers to uncomfortable levels.  No fatigue either, and i'm in commonly in front of them for longer than 8 hours at a session....in fact, i look forward to it.  An ingenious driver in an equally ingenious cabinet.....my only complain is i wish they were manufactured somewhere else, just out of principle.",P
278,1397,"Full, rich, natural and dynamic sound","The Christmas sale presented an amazing opportunity to get this system, which would have been worth the list price, but was a steal at the sale price! The speakers are small enough to place just about anywhere, and the design of the stands are such that they can be mounted on the wall or placed on any flat surface. Putting Mad Max on full-blast was like being in the theater, or even like being there in the action. The center speaker could throw the sound a bit better, and some of the surround sound gets lost at lower volumes, but anything from mid-range is brilliant. The subwoofer really packs a punch and makes you appreciate even the opening sequences, such as the opening to HBO shows, where you get that little surge of sound. ",P

291,1355,Best point source mini monitor speakers,"I have been enjoying music and bought and sold a couple of good monitor speakers that were considered low in price but high value for performance for about 30 years.

I'm using a 2A3 integrated at reasonable volume and it produces a smooth and relaxing sound.  This is a speaker that will last you many years of good music enjoyment. Cheers!",P
293,1262,"Great sound, but . . .","I agree completely with Chris.  These cables provide wonderful sound with the M500  phones, and fortunately the cost for replacement isn't terrible.  Just know that you WILL be replacing the cable..  They are the electronic equivalent of osteoporosis.  I realize that it might not look as ""elegant"", but I wish KEF would produce a stronger cable with 2.5mm/3.5mm male leads for the M500.  I would happily pay more for longer-lasting cables. ",A

296,1177,Exceeds my expectations,"I wanted the KEF E305 set to replace an older system which was attractive and complemented decor, but sounded unsatisfying in a new larger room.  

Compared to our significantly more complex and expensive setup in the basement theater, I was concerned about obtaining the improvement I was looking for, with the relatively modest outlay for the E305 system. I needn't have been concerned - the E305 system really does deliver and deserves the glowing reports it's received provided it is set up as instructed and you're not over ambitious about the size of room and volume level you're aiming for.  

We use it in a 22 x 28 room with 12' ceilings open to a lot of the house for general TV and movie viewing. The whole is definitely greater than the sum of the parts - the sound is superbly integrated, dialogue is crystal clear and the subwoofer does a great job of filling in the lower frequencies and communicating effects. 

All in all, choosing the E305 system has been money very well spent. You really only need to spend more if you need to fill a very large room, or want subwoofers to move the furniture around. ",P
305,1143,Everything you've heard is true...,"Went through a lot of demo speakers before pulling the trigger on the LS50's.  In short, nothing compares and all that you have heard and read about these speakers is true.  Build quality and sound is simply amazing.  Worth every penny.",P
306,1355,"Sleek, Sexy and Sounds Superb","I was always on the fence about getting these but having read almost no ill reviews of the speakers throughout the web, and even without demoing them, I decided to take the plunge and get one of the last pairs of Racing Red.  They are sleek, sexy and sound incredible!  They are crystal clear and have a very crisp sound for their size.  The red is absolutely glamours and compliments its tremendous sound.  I trialed two different amps before I was satisfied as they really deserve the best power to drive their incredible sound and reach their full potential.  They really hit all frequencies in the spectrum well, could hit harder a little lower in bass but that is were a subwoofer takes over (not required by any means though).

307,1156,Clear as Day & White as Night!,These replaced my smaller & older KEF Coda 80 center channel.  I really wanted to upgrade and boy did I strike gold!  I bought the white finish and it looks superb and sounds even better.  It drives the vocals in my home theatre setup and couldn't be clearer and more dynamic with the vocals.  Could close my eyes and swear the actors were in the room.  A little on the heavy side but no price to pay for quality build and superior sound.  Love me some KEFs!,P

Modern aesthetics
Excellent build quality
Unparalleled sound in this segment, both size and budget

If you give these the proper treatment, you'll be happy for a long time. Personally using a Matte Black/Blue LE pair matched with a Schiit Gumby/Ragnarok combo, which is also in black. Simply amazing sound, and not too bad on the eyes either.

**Also wanted to briefly comment on Kef Direct and their service. I was originally sent a pair in the classic piano black finish by mistake. Made a quick phone call and Dan took care of everything with no hassle whatsoever. Top shelf product, and top shelf service.",P
314,1143,Recommended,Little loud speaker!,A
315,1143,Simply Amazing,"I must say that I am amazed at these little loudspeakers! My current speakers are ProAc Response 2.5 which were purchased well over 10 years ago at a cost of $5,000 – the current model is called D28 which represents a slight improvement and retails for $6,250 . The KEF LS50 simply buries them! Dynamics, imaging, clarity – it’s all there. Alright, so the ProAc’s have a stronger bass, but frankly I prefer the KEF’s lighter touch, seems more in scale and certainly adequate.

I am finding myself pulling out all these old records I haven’t listened to for years and enjoying it immensively, never would have thought that a mere change in technology could rekindle musical enjoyment, but there’s no arguing with success.

Makes me wonder what The Blade can do – turn heavy metal into violin sonatas?",P
316,1143,"Design is not for everyone, but excellent sound for the money",Amazing clarity and detail on vocals and acoustics. I really wish they had grills though as the shiny brass drivers can be an eyesore (they are for me.),P
317,1143,"Overall, a great pair. ","Overall, they are delightful to listen to. Add a sub and you might never need a big pair of speakers. 

I have them matched with the following: 

Vincent 236 Hybrid Integrated Amp 
Thorens TD-309 Turntable with Shure MX-97E Cartridge 
Pro-Ject Tube Box SE II Phono Pre-amp 
Oppo BD-95 Universal Player 
Olive Media Server 


Test Music 

Vinyl - the most crucial test 

Buckingham Nicks - ""Crying in the Night"" from German LP Pressing - Incredible album - musically and sonically - but has never been re-released and the US vinyl copies universally suck - the German pressing is quiet and Lindsey's guitars jumped out into the room with me 

Fleetwood Mac - ""Dreams"" - from recent 45 rpm double LP - This pressing beats the Japanese SACD and the US DVD-A. Its often a toss-up between these three formats (if a recording is lucky enough to get all 3) but the vinyl in this case is the winner - clean, quiet and ultra-transparent 

Olivia Newton-John - ""Country Girl"" - from Japanese Pressing of Long Live Love LP - Japanese vinyl is meticulously well crafted and regardless of what you think of this aritst,, her early country recordings (coming out of England) with Cliff Richard's old Shadows band on back-up and producing - are magnificent. Great guitars, superb sonic layers, and a clear, clean voice that some speakers can't get right - but not the KEFs! 

CD 

Eagles - ""New Kid in Town"" from the West German Target CD - very early ""flat"" transfer - sounded superb - this is the Eagles CD to own - later versions have tinkering with the sonics 

SACD 

Eric Clapton - ""Give ME Strength"" from 461 Ocean Boulevard - guitars were warm and sweet and jumped out at you 

Olive Server - I hate compression but Olive does pretty well 

Vanessa Williams - ""Midnight Blue"" from ""Everlasting Love"" - great cover of the Melissa Manchester classic - sounded much better than I expected. 

Overall, a great pair.",P
318,1143,These speakers are little gems!,"I have owned a number of loudspeakers over the years starting with Polk, Martin Logan, Magnepan and Gallo. While they all had their strengths, none have impressed me as much as the LS50's. From the excellent build quality to the balanced sound and deceptive small physical size, these speakers are impressive. The LS 50's disappear and present the music with accuracy-,clear highs, articulate, realistic vocals and punchy bass-the LS50's are so enjoyable to listen to. For the size and price, they are hard to beat. ",P
319,1143,It's all true~!,"Even with very little break-in, I can tell you that John Atkinson in Stereophile was absolutely correct: Class A for smaller rooms. Also, read the What HiFi review. 

These are solid as a rock, gorgeous finish, and provide the most amazing clarity I've ever heard. Wow! What a soundstage! Don't hesitate. If you love classics, Jazz, and vocal music, you will be in heaven.",P
322,1178,Nice,Nice product !!!,P
323,1203,Reset again and agian,The sound quality of the speaker is amazing. It will automatically disconnect you while you are watching movie or listening song with the usb. The number of times i have to reset these speakers are uncountable. The sound quality is really amazing. I love this speaker. I've contacted the customer service and all they said was remove all the cables from speaker and leave it that way for 60 minutes (reset). I just got it for about 6 months and i am getting tired of resetting the speaker again and again.,N
324,1161,Incredible Value,"I had Kef Q60's for nearly 20 years, and was so pleased with them, I wanted to stay with Kef when I upgraded.  A few weeks ago, I bought a pair of Q500's to use in stereo as opposed to surround.  I listen to mostly classical, and the Q500's are truly amazing for the price.  I use a sub for a little extra punch in orchestral music, but it isn't really needed for chamber music.  The Q500's play with amazing clarity, and the sound stage is extremely well defined and seems almost 3 dimensional.  For the price, these speakers are spectacular.",P
331,1153,"Reminds me of my old Roger LS 35As, but better","I bought a pair of these from KEF during their Christimas special and hooked them up to a decent upper end midfi system: with a Rotel power amp and OPPO 105d disc player.

I adjusted the Oppo so that it would cut off the signal to the R100s at 80 hertz, which significantly improved the clarity of the speakers without significantly affecting the base. It was a neat trick that the OPPO allows but few others as far  as I know. (The OPPO can also serve as a preamp, reducing the number of places where noise can be introduced.)

With this setup the R100s are really excellent, with more base than you would think, and as excellent small speakers tend to, they provide really detailed imagery and detail which is limited only by the quality of the recording  itself.  They are best at voices and acustic music,  not working  as well at the ""big sound"" required for a full orchestra, but doing fine at lush sounds like those typical of Enye, Pink Martini, the audiofile samples on SACDs, and most soft to moderately hard rock and country.  

My larger speakers took up too much space in the living room, and they've been shifted to another location. Listening to the R100s reminded me of my old Roger's LS35As which I listened to for years, but the R100s seem more detailed and smoother than I remember those units. With good small speakers like these, the speakers themselves disappear, being replaced with a fine sound stage, one so large that you cannot beleive they are produced by such small units.  This is less true of big speakers, precisely because they are so big, and some how contributes to the attraction of high quality small speakers, even if one sacrifices a bit of base and impact.  ",P
332,1163,Perfect for the office,"Was looking for a desktop speaker that would work great nearfield  sitting on my office desk.  I wasn't happy with the studio monitor options I tried. The Q100 finally ended that search. They can be put close to a wall,  image great, and are easy to drive. Highly recommended for a smaller space. ",P

335,1232,kef C3 bookshelf speakers,These speakers were selected from 8 pairs down too one.  These speakers are worth the price and the sound quality are wonderful.

338,1162,Significant upgrade with versatility and sound quality,"I bought these to replace existing (and excellent) tower speakers that I was relocating in the house.  I read the reviews and researched.   These don't disappoint.  Sound quality is excellent, space saved, and the aesthetics in the room are improved.  I use them in a 5.1 setup, but primarily for 2 channel music.        ",P
340,1163,Happy first time KEF owner,"Q100s are detailed and dynamic studio monitors that are exceptionally musical.  The Uni-Q driver projects a wide, coherent soundstage that is very three dimensional, even without high end electronics.   Great build quality.  Easy upgrade choice.",P
341,1216,Excellent discrete speaker,Using these for the rear channels in a home theater set up. Good complement to the Qseries front channels and a great way to complete the system in a visually discrete way.  I don't need more bass since the sub handles it. Recommend.,P

400,1440,Made me loose weight!,My wifi would always drop out and my Kef Wireless speakers sounded alright.

What a miracle spray.,P
401,1440,Stunning,Easily replaces all that came before it. Better than living in Death Valley.,P
402,1440,Not to be missed!,"I consider myself a lucky person.  I've done well for myself in life, have a Lamborghini in the garage (it's fun to drive up here in the Hollywood hills), and my wife most certainly wouldn't be around without my bank account.

That being said, there's nothing like being able to have a party with a houseful of people that  I despise (and a few d-list celebrities looking to network) telling me, incredulously,  how clear and fast my wifi signal is.

I'm not going to tell them my secret because I know that when they go to a party at Jake Busey's place, his wifi won't even reach the above ground pool in his backyard.

Thanks, KEF.  The Hydro Blaster makes me the envy of all the soulless, and plastic jerks that I so desperately want to like me.",P
403,1235,The Little KEF that could,"Got this sub a few months ago when I got a 5.1 set from KEF.  I already had a sub that I was happy with so I didn't know how much if at all the C4 would get used.  However, once I had the other speakers setup I decided to check this guy out.  I put the C4 ontop of my other subs and plugged in the LFE in the back.  

With the gain on half I was simply blow away at the volume this little 8"" sub was putting out.  The bass is tight and controlled but still room filling.  The low end extension is also very impressive.  Will this power down to below 20Hz levels...no it wont.  It's an 8"" driver but it will dig down for almost everything in a movie track.  I have since retired my old sub and kept this one as my main sub.  

Don't let the size of the C4 fool you it's a real deal sub.  I love the fact that I can get this much sound out of such a small package.  I think that is where it shines.  Being able to fit into a room and not be the centerpiece of the space but still deliver good quality bass.  ",P
404,1440,overkill,"This stuff makes the sound too dry.  It's like living in an egg crate foam lined recording booth, but with an industrial dehumidifier.  I get nosebleeds whenever I spray this stuff.  My speakers aren't KEF, though.  Maybe it's a compatibility issue?",N
405,1440,Standing out!,"I was having questions about the sound quality coming out of my KEF R500/R200c/R100 setup, fed by my Bluesound product via wireless. Well, after applying Hydro Blaster I was able to disconnect even the power cord and had better sound! Amazing product, highly recommended!",P
406,1440,This product saved my life!,"I suffer from chronic humiditosis, and I can't believe how much this product has changed my life.  I used to have to wait minutes, sometimes tens of minutes, for my ten dollar -reusable- humidifier to begin to relieve my symptoms.  Now, with Hydro Blaster Spray I only have to wait one maybe two minutes -three tops- for the humidity in my home to reach tolerable levels.  Not only is my pain -mostly- gone, but now I can hear that crisp clear audio bliss sooner than every before. 

Thank you Kefdirect, and thank you Hydro Blaster Spray. 

Humiditosis.  It could be real!",P
407,1440,This is amazing for every use also...,"So I received this can some days ago, took it to the audiophile room, and wait to came back from work to review it. But things didn't go as planned, my wife mistakenly use this product to clean the furniture!!, so when I tried to use it the can was empty, omg. But then I looked my exotic  furniture (that type of  wood is less than 0,02% in the planet) and Whoa!! , now it is cleaner and shinning than ever!, and I also can hear best quality sound ever.Dunno why but it is ok.     Thank you KEF!. ",P
8180,1160,700s,"Bought the Q700s on the weekend. Great deal, too: $1078 Cdn for a PAIR! Got home, set them up, and started to listen. Haven't stopped. These speakers are remarkable. STUNNING sound! Better than I have ever had. The soundstage is full and there's a lush warmness my previous speakers - a pair of Linn Nexus I had for a couple of decades - could not reproduce. I thought the Linns sounded good enough - they were LINNS after all! - but the Q700s easily knock them out of the way. Where the Linns were bright and sometimes even harsh - that was a fault of that speaker when playing rock, for example - the Q700s sound velvety smooth and completely lack any kind of harshness whatsoever. Each instrument and voice is well placed and clear.  I have read reviews that claim the bottom end on the Q700s is not adequate enough, but I honestly don't find that top be true. In fact, I would not want the bass to be any  more pronounced than these puppies are producing. A subwoofer would be overkill and, I think, muddy the sound (I am using these for stereo playback, not video surround sound). The highs and mids are clear and utterly effortless. I am using a Linn LP 12 and a Riga Brio amp, which powers the speakers beautifully and efficiently. For CDs I am using a Marantz CD6005, which is a great CD player. CDs through the CD6005 and  the Q700s do not sound like, well, CDs. The is no edginess typical of the medium, and I am finding myself rummaging through boxes of stored CDs that I haven't played in years. Really, these speakers are that good!Very highly recommended, especially at a good price.",P

8184,1199,Perfect parameters,"I bought these from KEF Direct around Christmas time, a gift for myself so I could listen to music later at night without bothering others. I got more that I imagined. The sound quality rivals my wonderful KEF R500/R200c/R100 and sub setup. They are supremely comfortable for hours of use, and I really appreciate that my wife starts talking to me and I can't hear a thing. She can't either, so until she looks at me and sees the M500 on my head there's no telling I'm listening to music. You have to be within a foot or two to know the headphones are playing, even at somewhat elevated volume. You don't get this with an open back headphone set. I have no problem driving them from my Android phone, tablet, computer or receiver.

As a machinist I appreciate the fine metalworking of the M500. As a music lover I appreciate the rich sound. True that others dig deeper but I don't feel I'm missing anything. These are the first I've owned that do not make my ears all sweaty or make me feel claustrophobic. That they are a quality product in terms of both build and sound, I expect long life.",P

I really appreciated the bass response, the difference between 2.0 and 2.1 is minimal particularly for music.

8320,1168,Excelent BUT,"It is a great looking / sound speaker but 3 minor issues:
1- I wish the side white front panel were on both sides to give it a more balance look. The right side could be removable for those who like the single side look.
2- During installation I had only one option to rout the wire behind the speaker which I needed to rout from the other side.
3- The white box looking side panel in front of the speaker (I think) has the main electrical component and for some reason it collect dust. I think it creates magnetic filed that's how it attracts dust but it can easily been whipped away. I'm talking about maybe once a month depending on where you live.",N
8324,1144,Fantastic,"I love this single speaker for the center channel and it passed the wife test. I think it is the best setup that I could have with the limitations that my wife has for our Feng Shui. She did not like the college dorm room look we previously had.

8326,1143,Wow!,"I recently purchased some LS50s for a 2nd system to place in the master bedroom. I am completely blown away. Without available grills, the look would never be described as understated, but they look beautiful to me and the limited edition colors help improve the ability to at least match your decor. Combined with a Creek Evo 100a, they sound spectacular and have far more bass than I expected from a speaker this size. In fact, I'm glad I hadn't yet purchased a subwoofer because for me it simply won't be needed in this setup. I've heard much larger and more expensive rigs that don't come close to the level of music reproduction I have available on one shelf. Fantastic!",P
8329,1355,"Kef LS50 bookshelves, as good as a small speaker can get","first off I use these speakers in an unconvenient spot in my family room against a wall and above ear levels.  
They sound great there but not as good as they can.  I have a dedicated listening room where I have a much bigger
system and a proper amount of sound proofing and some acoustical performance room paneling.  I brought them 
into that room to burn them in and that's where I was blown away by these small speakers.  Probably the best sound staging
and balanced sound I've ever heard from a small package.  The mids and highs were nice, not too bright and the bass was 
pretty rich from such a small driver.  (i'm use to 4 10 inch woofers blasting at me).  If you can position them about three feet from each wall
and have them at ear level, toed in a bit, you will be blown away...if you have to compromise like I have you will still be happy.  Very
satisfied with my purchase!
",P
8330,1350,Really good system with 1 major flaw,"I have been using these speakers as my primary desktop speakers. I love the sound quality that these speakers produce and they look really good too while doing that. I was really happy till one fine day I was studying and they started playing music while on standby... I checked all my tabs in chrome, could not find the source for the music... I noticed it was connected via Bluetooth, which was weird since I directly play them through the desktop always, have used Bluetooth only while testing initially. After further testing I found that the Bluetooth of this system is always discover able when not in use too. This has lead to quite a few headaches for me, one night while I was sleeping someone connected to the speakers and started blasting music through them. After contacting KEF regarding this, they said the only way to really avoid this is by using a power strip and switching of the speakers when not in use and they did not have any solution for it yet. This is really inconvenient since 

1) I like to listen to music before sleeping, now I cant fall asleep listening to it since I have to switch it off.
2)Placing a power strip at an accessible position would negate all the work I put in to get my desk clutter free. 

This was not something that I expected from such an expensive set of speakers and a reputed brand name such as KEF, there are much cheaper products from no name brands that understand the importance of not allowing a Bluetooth device to be always discover able, I don't understand why engineers at KEF would do this, there is no practical reason to have them always on.

I have been very pleased with the ease of installation and quality of the music so far although still breaking in after only a couple of days. Shipping and price were very fair for the quality.,P
8334,1143,Small size/Big performance,"I just replaced my amplifier recently and I thought it was time to replace my old speakers (Kef Q1).  After reading numerous articles I decided on the Kef LS50 based on sound reviews and also the size component.
I picked the Titanium,  when they arrived, I felt they were bigger and heavier than I expected.  I guess that is normal coming from the Q1s ;-)

I hooked them up, I did read the manual and they have instructions where to best place the speakers.  Unfortunately, I couldn't place them where they mentioned and had to use the foam for the port hole.

The sound was great.   I then started to listen older music just hear the difference, and I hear nuances that I couldn't hear with my older speakers.   It even got better over time.  I know it can be even better placed more away from the wall.  I just have to find floor stand that matches the design (and color)...  Haven't so far (probably a market to take there)
My only regret is not to be younger so that my hear can the full range that the speaker can deliver ;-)

By the way the Gray Titanium looks really great with the copper speaker, the design looks really modern!",P

8391,1169,"Great and beautiful speakers, awesome sound","Firstly these speakers  have a design that is very sleek and modern, my pair is white to match the marble fireplace.  They are very low profile which at first would make you suspicious of the sound quality, but once set up I was amazed at the sound quality.  I'm certainly not an audiophile but these 2 speakers along with the center channel replaced a very large BIC America sound bar (which was also nice but was too large for my new layout).      This is set up in a great room that is over 3000 ft^3 so If wasn't expecting them to fill the room but I was presently surprised, these leave me wanting for nothing, I highly recommend them.",P
8392,1168,Beautiful sound and looks,"I bought this to pair up with the T301 R/L speakers and I purchased the set in white.   They look awesome and my only complaint visually on the center channel is that the dead space on the white part of the speaker is not symmetric.... which makes it look like just a R/L speaker tilted 90 degress (which indeed is what it is).  That is a minor gripe, otherwise I'm fully satisfied.

The speakers are very low profile which at first would make you suspicious of the sound quality, but once set up I was amazed at the sound.

8397,1203,"Great product,  great sound, one suggestion....","I recently purchased a pair of KEF 300AW from KEF's website as they were offering a limited time great deal.  I found the setup materials a bit confusing, but thanks to a tip found in someone's review I used the iPhone app and all went well.  Customer satisfaction would be improved if they included a 5 meter (16.4 ft) USB to USB mini cable with the speakers.  Unless you are just using the speakers on a desk, the cable provided is too short.  All that being said, I love their sound, lovely appearance and would look at KEF for any future speaker purchases.",A
8402,1203,Use iPhone with App to set up,"First of all, I hope to help the next person set up the awesome speakers in their home.  I tried to use Macbook and iPad with no luck.  Used iPhone with the app and  within minutes they were set up.  I may have missed the note to use iPhone or it wasn't listed anywhere convenient.  Using airplay is one of the main reasons I got these speakers.  I get home and hit play on my device while still in the garage and I've got music welcoming me home after a long day.  The x300aw fills the room with awesome (full & rich) sound.  I may not have them positioned at the best possible location but they work wonderful and look fantastic.  I've been a huge KEF fan since I purchased my 1st pair over 20 years ago.  Sure wish I could get a pair for my office, but would be way to much speaker for my office.  I've been following these for some time and when the price dropped, I snatched myself a pair.  ",P
8405,1199,These are FABULOUS.,"I was on the fence about these headphones after reading many reviews.  I was concerned about comfort and sound quality.  But I have been a KEF guy since the late 1970's and I own to this day a pair of 105.2 Reference and a pair of 104.2 Reference Series Loudspeakers.  This pair of headphones was a Christmas gift to me from my wife 7 months ago and I have worn them a LOT.   I'm fortunate, I guess, in that she found them online for $149.  And I am a happy guy to own these.

I can't say that these are the absolute most comfortable pair of headphones I have worn in my life because I prefer an over the ear headphone and I sincerely hope that the fine folks at KEF will build a pair.  That said I can attest to the fact that the ear pads are soft as butter and I've never experienced excessive heat.  I have a ""Gordo"" sized melon and have had to manipulate these a tad.  I would suggest that anyone do the same to make them fit their own head.

I find these headphones to be true to the KEF sound that I have loved since my teen years.  NO, they won't hammer you with BASS like my 105's can, but I have found myself shaking my head more than once while listening to these headphones.  At times (depending on source material/recording) it's been like having actual speakers on each ear.  That is to say, like not thinking I were listening to headphones at all.

I will say, these fine headphones won't stay on your head if you need to bend over to pull up your socks and they are not for portable use.  I wanted to use them at home anyway but they have dropped to the carpet a time or two.  Just a heads up.

A fine first effort from KEF and I'm a nearly 40 year fan of this wonderful company.

  ",P
8406,1151,Perfect,"Great combination of looks and sounds. These are such an attractive set that produce quality sound, I've actually considered a set of r300 for the living space as well. Be sure to back them with a strong amp. I'very bi-amped them with  two MC2255's which really help bring out thier depth.",P
8408,1203,"Solid performers, although the wireless system could use improvement","Despite reading the tech specs, the weight when receiving the box is unexpected... they are heavy! Having ordered the white finish version, the side material is a white vinyl, while the front panel is a smooth surface. I personally would have preferred having that smooth surface for the whole enclosure or maybe a high-gloss finish. The rough vinyl cheapens the appearance in my opinion. So the knock of one start in ""build quality"" is due to that. However, the actual build quality is completely solid, 5 stars there.

As for the setup, it is fairly straight forward, once you find the software. I initially had some trouble finding that software on the site. A Google search pointed me to the right place though. I guess the download link could be placed a bit more prominently or be included directly in the order confirmation email. - I first set them up wirelessly on my Mac, as this is the main selling point over the X300A. It works fine for most of the time but as others have mentioned, the connection sometimes drops. Most often when waking the computer from sleep. Which is another thing;  the speakers themselves go into sleep mode after 20mins of inactivity when just setup wirelessly and it takes a couple seconds before they wake up again. This is fairly common among wireless speakers, just not quite sure why. They have their own power supply, it's not like they run on battery where this would be expected. Another thing to be aware of when wireless, is that there is a noticeable lag when scrubbing through a song. Just feels a bit odd. - The combination of these various ""issues"" made me switch to a wired setup, where none of this happens. I just use wireless mode when using the iPhone. It works fine for the short bursts of time I use them this way. - If your main purchase decision is driven by the wireless functionality, then I probably would not recommend the X300AW. Unless you can live with some wireless oddities.

One thing where the KEFs set themselves apart from other USB connected speakers is that you can control the volume from the  computer's master volume. Most others require to control this on the speaker, which is annoying. So a big plus here. As for the sound quality; very well balanced overall. The bass response is just right for my purpose, which is in a smallish studio (apt), setup on a desk fairly close (5in) to the wall. While it doesn't reach subwoofer level, I do not need/want that. There is generally plenty lows to provide a full range. The mids and highs are well separated and clear, although I think that the highs could use a bit more punch. This might just be me though, having gotten used to the previous speaker setup. I can just adjust my EQ a bit to tweak to my liking. Aside from that, I love the stereo soundstage of these speakers, absolutely amazing!

Overall, high quality speakers in regards to sound quality. If you're going for the wireless feature, just be aware of its limitations.",A
8447,1199,M500 poor build quality,I think these are designed for old people who only sit at home and listen to music. For young people who constantly take them on and or slide them off our ears to talk with friends the cups fall apart. First the leather splits at the seam then the foam falls out. All this in less than a year of normal use. Buy something more mobile friendly or uou will be stuck with hard plastic on your ears like I am,N

8470,1174,Definitely the best option for KEF T301 surround speakers,"I tried using two types of ""universal fit"" speaker stands that I already had but the high T301 speakers were unstable with the use of only one screw to hold them. The T Series Floor Stands are sturdy, made of high quality materials and provide a very sturdy base, plus they give a fashionable look to the T301 speakers. They are a bit pricey but definitely worth it! ",P
8472,1227,Phenomenal value,"Genuinely impressed with the sound quality of the Ventura speakers, as they provide great sound in open space.  Additionally they look as good as they sound.  They are a great value for such a high end outdoor speaker!",P
8473,1201,Great sound for a very simple setup. IMO X300A's are the best bang for the buck.,"I ordered this system because I wanted a simple, but great sounding speaker system to take south during our annual snowbird migration to FL. I already own a pair of LS50's which always sounded great for their diminutive size, but always wished KEF had an active (self powered) option so I wouldn't need to pack my amp/dac/cables etc. The Uni-Q combo design for the tweeter/mid is my primary reason for buying KEF speakers. Lets face it folks, the quality of the vocals and sound imaging using KEF's are always breath taking. I own 205/2 Reference speakers, LS50's and now X300A's... I think I might be obsessed with the KEF sound.

When the X300A was featured on special here, it was a no brainer for me to give them an audition. I'm happy to say I will NOT be returning these great little speakers. The sound quality excels at this price point, and the attached amp is well matched for the speakers. I couldn't ask for anything better than this compact setup to stream my music collection to. They sound so great in my listening area, that my sister is planning to purchase the same setup for her exercise room. I'm currently using a Mac mini (headless) to stream my flac files @ 24/96 via USB to the X300A's built in DAC and amp. I haven't tried hooking up my iPod Touch to the speakers yet, but I'm confident that option would sound good too. Give these active speakers a chance, I don't think you'll be disappointed.",P
8485,1143,A superb glorious speaker!,"My previous speaker was a Kef Q300, my system is pure computer, a Parasound Zdac V.2, audioquest evergreen RCA cables, Audioquest Jitterbug drives all for a non-expensive Sansui AU-a607 Extra recapped 130 rms in 4 ohms per speakers. The sound is insane period... with a stands just shines over all speakers I ever heard. The q300 was a excellent speaker, but the resolution and refinement in the LS50 is just perfect. Awesome job KEF! ",P
8487,1396,Met all of my expectations,"Speaker fit nicely on  the dresser below my wall mounted TV.  It sounds great  and blends well with my wall mounted Kef speakers.

Good purchase 
Pat",P
8488,1200,"Sweet Sound, Light weight, Very impressed nice isolation","At the beginning I though it is hard to put it on, after watching the introduction on Youtube and tried it on, it's more comfortable and lighter than I expect. And it comes with extra pairs of silicon feel earphone tips which is a great offer for different size of ear hole.

I originally have M500, compare to the on ear set, the performance of this M200 in-ear set is way more better than I expect, especially hearing vocal music.

Since the isolation is so great, the sound quality from the album came out more clear and ""sweeter"" than usual.

The only point of discount is the control button, the touch is a little ""rough"", may be because of the rectangular shape instead of round tube shape!

Over all great product by KEF!",P
8489,1232,Very happy with the purchase!,They sound excellent for my purposes! Well Done!,P
8491,1262,Only Game in Town,"Unless you custom-build your own, this is the only readily-available cable for the m500.  And yes, they break every few months, but the sound is wonderful before they break.  If KEF cannot produce a more durable cable, they should admit that these are disposable and offer special pricing for multiple sets of this one.  A 2 or 3-pack might last for a year.",A
8493,1227,Great speakers for small spaces and limited mounting options.,Purchased these based on a recommendation from a friend who has both the 6 and 5 inch models.  I chose the 4 inch model as they would mount perfectly on the rail posts on my deck. I wanted the  Ventura 5 but they would stick out two far and cause a wife approval  issue. The Ventura 4's lack the lower end that the 5's and 6's have.  I will be installing dual outdoor subwoofers under the deck to resolve the lower bass issue. Currently it's pounding rain outside and the speakers are performing as expected.,P
8494,1201,Excellent  Sounds Quality,I own a bookshelf IQ30 over 5 years and very satisfy with the sound quality. Just bought a pair of X300A in my bedroom it provides more details and crispy sounds compare with my IQ30 with Onkyo AV AMP. It has to play 50 hours + to get the speakers in optimized conditions. Hooking up with my mac playing with Spotify music and you can remote control songs and volume by the Spotify apps from you phone. I would highly recommend this speakers that I would put in my bedroom for next 5-10 years without thinking to upgrade a new one.,P
8496,1262,Clean Sound,Cleanest sound I've ever had! Hands down.,P

",P
8499,1201,Excellent,"I was unsure how this product would perform when I ordered.  So far the x300a has been amazing with outstanding sound for their size. They are perfect for near-field listening and have decent bass. Keep in mind you won't get the deep powerful punch of a sub woofer and there is no easy way to add one. 

The build quality is solid and I love having the amp, DAC, and driver all in one tidy unit perfectly matched.

8500,1162,Scary good.,"In my never ending quest for the perfect bookshelf speaker without spending an insane amount of money, I believe my search has ended. I buy speakers and listen to them for a while, and as good as I originally thought they sounded, they always end up letting me down and wanting more. These Q300s are as close to the perfect ""bang for your buck"" speaker I have ever heard or owned.  I always hook up new speakers along with my old ones and A/B them for a few days and decide weather to keep them or not. These made the decision easy. They are on a whole other level and literally rend other speakers almost unlistenable.  From Tony Bennet to Stevie ray vaughn.  From david Bromberg to chopin.  Only question is now is what do I do now that my quest is over. Ah. Yes. Enjoy.",P
8501,1201,Best speakers in this price range,"Sounds good, built solidly, and great design, plus plug-and-play. Definitely won't anything else that's good in all these areas in this price range.",P
8517,1163,Excellent speakers,"I purchased the Q100's in order to replace a set of old school floor sized speakers with something smaller. They would be paired with a vintage amp. I was immediately blown away by how full the sound was in comparison to the old speakers. I was especially surprised by the lower end, which was the best I have heard from a speaker this size. Classic look is great. I am very satisfied with my purchase. ",P
8518,1163,Thank you KEF,"I ordered directly from KEF and the speakers were well packaged and arrived quickly. They impressed right out of the box, with a nice look and sound beyond their size. Highly recommended. ",P

8528,1143,Hands down best purchase of the year,"I had my eye on these speakers a while ago but finally decided to take the plunge.   It's re-invigorated my interest in listening to music in my living room (normally I'm with headphones and DAC from my home office with headphones).  Made me hook up my turntable again and loving music in my main room again.  They are a bit larger than you visualize when looking at pictures, but they fit nicely on my console. I also thought I would have to pull out my old sub from the basement, but no need. These speakers fill the room with a full range of sound. ",P
8529,1261,"Great headphones, comfortable ear pads","I am thankful that the earpads are back in stock. I bought 2 sets, because I use them so much. I am a professional audio engineer, and I can confidently say that these are the best sounding headphones I have ever experienced.",P

8536,1261,A great haedphone but!,The M500 is a great headphone but the only problem is the Ear pads. The ear pads seem to give way too soon. It needs to be improved and once that is accomplished the M500 will deserve a full 5 stars in my book.,N
8537,1163,"My first ""proper"" speakers","I'm not much of an audiophile, I only learned about the speakers through a friend who knew I was looking to get some real speakers for my apartment.

Look-and-feel is tremendous. They have a great weight and solidity and I love the details in the cones. European Walnut trim is an elegant finish.

I've been listening to them for about 2 weeks now. I was pleasantly surprised at the bass response given their size: not very powerful, but good range. A lot of reviews I've seen describe them as being quite ""bright"" sounding. I would agree: the higher frequencies sound almost too clear in relation to the lower tones. I am using these in conjunction with a subwoofer though, so this bothers me less.

I purchased these on sale $299.99, which I think is an excellent price for someone looking to get some entry level equipment. ",P
8538,1163,Great Speakers - especially on sale,Bought these to replace a larger set of floor standing speakers. Great sound especially for the size. Good controlled bass and does not need a sub for music. Very happy with them.,P

The treble is a slight bit ""crunchy"" and there is an ever so slight mid bass bloat, but for the money the over all sound is outstanding!",P

8549,1162,Excellent speakers for the price.,These are excellent speakers for the price with clear crisp sound.  I added the Q400 sub woofer to supply the necessary bass which cannot be produced by the small speakers in the Q300.  While this is a lower end KEF product you get great sound without breaking the bank.,P
8550,1162,Best I have heard under $800,"The KEF Q300's have impressive imaging and the soundstage was everything that I had read about while researching these prior to purchase.  It came down to these or the Dali Zensor3.  I chose the Kef's because the lower frequencies were a notch better to my ears, not boomy at all.  Nice extension and tight when called upon.  I chose the white finish to make the purchase easier to explain to the Wife, compromise is key.  While I would have  loved the finish to be a gloss or piano variant, they blend well and do not attract finger prints.  Easy to clean.  Grills stay on because of the kids, but they sure are classy looking with them off.  No difference in sound with the covers on or off.  I have around 20 hours into the pair, and they sound beautiful to my ears.  They shine with everything that I have thrown at them including Classical, Country, Blues and Classic Rock.  And they are equally impressive for movies.  I have the Kef's powered by a Kenwood Vintage Integrated Amp pushing 45 Watts RMS.  These things sing loud, I never get past the 5th or 6th notch on the volume dial.  These are easy to power, just make sure the power and source is clean.  Im currently shopping for a USB DAC to step up to the next level with these speakers.  I loving my decision on these, and are very sufficient for my 20' X 14' TV room.  Sound is incredible coming out of these speakers.  I have them a top Sanus 28"" speaking stands keeping the uni-q driver at ear lever while seated.  Speakers are staged 8' apart on center, slightly towed inward.  This seems to be the ideal positioning for my room layout.  All hardwood floors in my house, no unwanted resonation.  These babies are braced very well inside I assume.  A simple knock on the cabinet and rock solid.  Around 20lbs a piece.  Enjoy.",P

8553,1163,Excellent sound and looks,"Replaced B&W and Rotel for a smaller system. I am impressed. For the price,  you will not find anything better.  You need 50w clean to power (or more). ",P
8554,1161,Great speakers,"I bought these along with a pair of Q300's to use as surround speakers in a 7.1 system. However, prior to putting them in the 7.1 system I hooked them up in a bedroom system for a bit of break in listening to 2-channel music.  These are excellent sounding speakers on their own; accurate with tight bass and a an overall well balanced sound. The only reason I give them 4 starts and not 5 is that I own a pair of R900s and an R600C up front in my 7.1 system. The R900s are absolutely fantastic but I will say that the Q500 hold their own and I would highly recommend these speakers.  ",P
8555,1162,Fantastic speaker for the size and price!,"I bought a pair of Q300s and Q500s to use as surrounds in a 7.1 system to go along with my R900 and R600C. I have been very happy with the R900 and wanted to upgrade my prior surrounds to KEF and couldn't resist the sale on the Q series. I broke in the Q300 and Q500 listening to 2 channel music before putting them in the surround system. I am very impressed with the Q300 - the sound was excellent, especially for their size. They were a great deal at the sale price but are worth it even at full list! The bass response was great as well as the sound stage. I would highly recommend these speakers and KEF in general.   ",P
8557,1163,Best bookshelf speakers in this price range,"This is my second pair of Q100, I loved the incredible clarity so much I purchased a second pair for my studio. The first pair are black but I went for walnut for the second one and I'm really happy I did. The finish is beautiful and more refined than the black version. The detail and soundstage are impressive for a speaker of this size,  I'm now officially a Kef fan!",P
8558,1163,Amazing Clarity,Loved the sound clarity... happy about the purchase,P
8559,1161,Amazing Sound,"I just purchased a pair of these on special along with a Q400b Sub for my home office/reading room, to say I am impressed is an understatement! The sound fills the room and I now hear music rather than just listen. I am sure that the upper range of KEF products would blow these away, but for me and for the price I am extremely please with my purchases. I will certainly be looking at more KEF in the future. ",P
8561,1168,Great sound!,"Performance for the size and price cannot be beat.  Love the speaker!  

For anyone looking to buy and install this (very easy install), keep in mind that the mount plate is NOT centered with speaker.  If you use the included template, you'll be ok.  However, if you use the mount plate to level and mark your holes, you will need to account for the offset (otherwise your speakers will be off-center to the right).   This is not to say the instructions aren't clear, it was definitely clearly marked on the template.   This was obviously user error in assuming the mount plate would be centered with the speaker...and you know what happens when you ASS U ME.  ",P
8562,1163,Great Small Setup,"I purchased these speakers for a home audio setup. On the day-to-day, I'm typically listening to studio monitors, but these offer an amazing listening experience compared to reference monitors. The sound is less directional, and fills the space more. There's a crispness in the sound. The Q100's have been a real joy.",P
8563,1162,EXCELLENT CHOICE,"I listen to baroque [and classical] music, and hence am very sensitive to the sound of gut [and steel] strings on wood, and the human voice. These sound like music. Most speakers in this price range don't. The vertical and lateral imaging is very good, solid with no wander, and benefit from the coincidence driver array. They are slightly laid back in terms of attack, warm in overall tone, and sweet [especially strings] and voices. They are very easy to listen to - which is what its all about. The build quality is good for the price, and the fit and finish is also quite good [better than B&W for instance]. The dual connector arrangement on the back is quite clever and hefty; however splitting the low and high frequencies via separate connectors does seem to have fallen out of fashion; the choice is yours. At their sale price, these are a no-brainer. At full price they are in the top ranks of everything that I have heard.",P
8568,1162,Took a chance and purchased them unheard,"I'm impressed. These replaced a pair of nearly 40 year old ADS L810 II speaker I bought new in 1978 for almost twice the
price of this pair (on sale). Although the Q300's don't have quite the bass impact of the 2 8"" units in the ADS models, The mids
and upper end are superior. Thats saying a lot since the ADS were pretty much state of the art in their day with a 3/4 dome tweeter
and a 2"" soft dome mid. Speaker technology has sure come a long way!",P
8569,1163,Not as good as anticipated,"The Q100's get glowing reviews, but I am disappointed.  The lows are somewhat lacking, and while the treble is clear, the mids seem boomy.  In fairness, they are replacing some Vandersteen Model 1 speakers, and don't have the best in amplification, and I'm listening to the Q100's in a new-to-me house.  But with all the kudos from wire cutter.com and others, I expected better.  Perhaps after more breaking-in, they'll improve: I hope so!",N
8570,1227,Short on bass but I expected that.,"Very smooth, modern  looking and a true bargain. Very good, neutral sound even if small size shorts you on bass but that's to be expected.  Suggest vertical mounting so water does not collect in depression around wire nuts.",A
8572,1162,Good,Great service. Received speakers on time and package perfectly. Great sound out of speakers.,P
8573,1262,Great sounding cable. Doesn't tangle.,Cables do short out. This time I'll just be more careful with it. I am pretty wreckless.,P
8574,1163,Delighted!,"I recently purchased a pair of KEF Q100 speakers and have been extremely delighted by them. 

I'm not an audiophile, but our family loves listening to music and watching movies at home. I own a pair of ancient Advent speakers from the 70s, but they are really worn down (had them in college), have been repaired a few times, and are too big for the living room in our new house. I spent a decent chunk of time researching great + affordable options for ~prosumer speakers. The review of the KEF speakers on Sweethome (sort of a meta-review site, affiliated with Wirecutter) was glowing. Oddly enough, the KEF Q series weren't listed as the best pick, but rather as the far superior, but more costly option. The reviewers must not have realized that the KEF speakers are on sale and actually cheaper than their other less good/expensive pick. After narrowing in on the KEFs, I looked for other reviews and did some checking on the audiophile subs on Reddit, and found lots of very positive discussions and comments on KEF in general and in the Q series. Based on all of that and the $299 price tag, I went for it.

We couldn't be happier. The sound is bright, clear, and intense. The one thing I was surprised by, despite seeing it in the reviews, is how well the speakers fill a room with sound. We have a large L-shaped living room with lots of huge windows. In the middle, to one side is our fireplace and on the other is our TV, media center, and speakers. We can be at either end of the room and it still sounds like both speakers are positioned towards you. We couldn't be happier.

In fact, I went ahead and bought a Q200C, which has been a great addition for movies/TV. I also have on my radar to pick up another pair of Q100s and a Q400b to round out a 5.1 setup. ",P
8576,1163,best speakers $300 can buy,"After a week of listening my wife and I are still amazed at all the new layers we hear in our favorite music. It's as if someone has removed cotton from our ears. I paired these speakers with a NAD 3020. Plenty of power, and for <$1,000 I couldn't be happier. The walnut finish is gorgeous",P
8577,1221,Perfect speaker to match my existing q900,"Wanted these as atmos speakers in my 5.1.2 setup. All other speakers were already from kef (q900, 600c, q100). Fit perfectly on the ceiling and sound quality was very good.",P
8615,1163,Could not be happier,"Fretted for a long time over which speakers to get and finally settled on these. They sound absolutely spectacular, could not be happier... maybe I should have sprung for the q300s!",P
8617,1175,Super sound surround !!,"Just installed these T-205s and all I can say is wow!  I don't impress easily , I was apprehensive of the sound quality at first, but was I pleasantly surprised.
I was immediately taken away with the crisp center channel.  My old systems center channel was muffled and hard to understand at times, the new system brings out the sounds and puts the sound where it belongs.  This system was so impressive, so improved, over the top that MY wife (who never offers) spoke up about how it makes the movie sound like we are sitting in the middle of a theater. Makes a fella want to watch all my movies over again!  Great surround with movies as well as 5.1 audio TV.  Give those engineers at KEF a raise for packing so much sound in so little space!  Made a Great self Christmas present.",P

8620,1261,"It's good, but I shouldn't need to buy it",It's a great replacement for the time when these things inevitably wear out! But also—I do wish that they'd last just a bit longer; the originals broke a bit earlier than I think is reasonable.,N
8622,1163,Excellent 'budget' hi-fi option,"I am running my Q100s with a Marantz PM6005 stereo receiver/amplifier. The speakers sound amazing; great imaging and clarity that I haven't heard before in my music.
At lower volume levels, the bass response is not great, but using the built in loudness setting on the amplifier really fills in the gaps. The speakers can dig pretty low for but not enough to be truly satisfying; I've ordered a Q400b sub to pair with them.
The Walnut finish is very nice, and the flat finish on the front of the speakers have a very sophisticated look. The speaker grill cloth on the front is very uniform and looks quite nice. 
My only complaint with the build quality is that one of the pegs holding the front  grill came off, but it was very easily glued back into place.

You can't do much better at this price point than these speakers. UniQ driver sounds excellent and is very forgiving of speaker placement.",P
8623,1227,Great KEF Quality,"Great sound from a small speaker. These were just what we needed. Small size, great sound at a terrific price. I am a big KEF fan.",P
8624,1227,Ventura 4,"What can I say, great price, build quality is amazing, and sound quality and bass is spot on for the size of the speaker, would definitely buy again",P
8626,1199,Amazing sound but delicate headphones,Would not recommend for anyone who travels or exercises a lot. The sound quality is excellent but these headphones were falling apart in not even a year. the headphone covers were falling off in no time.,N
8627,1163,Great speakers for the price point,"I have the Q100s connected as 2.0 to a Marantz PM6005 Stereo receiver/amplifier.
These speakers sound great. Excellent clarity, imaging, and punch. The uni-q dispersion really is good, and quite forgiving of speaker placement.
They dig pretty deep but don't have the most satisfying bass response, so I've gone ahead and purchased the Q400b sub. If you're in a pinch, these would do fine without a sub using some eq or the amplifiers 'loudness' setting to get some more 'oomf'.
Beautiful looking Walnut veneer, and very sophisticated matte finish on the front. The grill cloth is also very premium feeling and consistent in appearance.
Only complaint with build quality was that one of the pegs from the front grill fell off when removing it, but it was very easily glued back into place.
The Qs have a tonne of value. Definitely recommend.",P
8629,1160,Very smooth & musical!,"Been in Audio (including having my own high-end store for 15 years.) KEF's, especially the new Q & R series hit a home run for their price. If you are looking for a BOOM-TWEET look-at-me speaker, then new KEF's are probably not for you. But their errors from ""perfect"" are slightly subtractive making them very non-fatiguing & musical. Imaging size & depth and ability to fill the end of the room with beautiful, fun music with imaging & phasing vastly superior to speakers costing 2-3 times their price. They'll grow on you with their positive attributes rather than make you want to turn them off because they cause listening fatigue. Need some break-in 40-50 hours or so so don't judge them cold out of the box. Definitely Recommended for smaller to medium sized room. If your room is large, consider the Q900 for added SPL's and bass response.",P
8631,1175,AWESOME,"EASY INSTALLATION , AWESOME SOUND . STILL WORKING THRU MY RECEVIER ADJUSTMENTS. I AM VERY HAPPY WITH MY PURCHASE :)",P
8633,1163,Excellent speakers with flexible placement,"Bought as a gift for my parents. Powered with an Emotiva A100, it fills their large living room with room to spare (on the knob). Sound is excellent, zero complaints. What's key is that the speakers are rear ported, so you can place them relatively close to a wall without getting overpowered bass. And the hyped directionality is real; they sound great from any spot in the room. I also hooked up an Apple TV to the amp so my parents can Airlplay music to the speakers at any time without having to turn on anything. The speakers even look nice. My parents love the setup.",P
8634,1227,Excellent like most everything KEF makes,I had the big brother to these first and they are a great outdoor speaker. These are for arond the hot tun in another outside area and they did not disappoint. Great sound for outdoor speakers:),P
8635,1162,Bookshelf King,Fantastic speakers. You will not better quality for this price.,P
8636,1163,"Exceptional, detailed, and lively small speaker, with big sound!","I am 'beside myself' and utterly floored at the great sonics this small-ish speaker is capable of!  The sound is detailed and resolving, lively and lush, with great imaging and soundstage, as well as good taut bass.  I'm using the Q100's in a small office setup for mostly nearfield listening  in front of a large desk.  Even though my integrated amplifier is small and low-powered (APPJ 1501A tubed, pure Class A, 3.5 watts per channel), I am able to get more than ample volume out my KEF's with the amp's volume control around 11am or so.  You do NOT need much power to drive these speakers well, especially if your room is on the small size.  Incidentally, my other speakers include Magnepan MG12QR, JBL Studio 530, and vintage Polk Audio Monitor 10B's.  All phenomenal speakers in their own right!",P
8637,1163,Exceptional quality,"Very aesthetically pleasing, loving the walnut grain. Compared it to a Klipsch reference, much better clarity on mids/highs, absolutely amazing for music.",P
8639,1162,Great speakers,"I'm just starting to build my home theater and got these as the right/left front channel because I have bookshelves they need to fit in. I considered several, but glad I chose these. They look and sound great. I'd definitely recommend them. ",P
8641,1160,Awesome,"Steve
What cani say.  Before I say anything about the speakers let me first say I think your staff is first class.  Talked to  a salesman wish I could remember his name.  Very knowledgeable and willing to give me the time I needed.  The speakers.  Superb.  Don't understand some reviewers only giving them 4 stars for build quality.  They're so beautiful I don't want to get near them for fear I might scratch one of them. By the way they also sound wonderful.  Couldn't be more pleased.",P
8643,1163,"Full, rich sound -- excellent price","Even after reading glowing reviews, I didn't expect these to sound as good as they do.",P
8644,1158,R400b - perfect match for Video and Music,"After a few years with my KEF system , I finally added the R400b to complement the setup. 
I have been running the XQ5, XQ2, and XQ1 on an Denon AVR4308 for a few years. Listening to music was the major duty of the system. However, after a while watching movies became more frequent. Optic is just as important as build quality to me. So, I added the R400b to system. My expectations were high, as I LOVE my XQs in every aspect. And the R400b met every little bit of my expectations. The build quality is outstanding. It matches nicely the high gloss finish of my speakers. The setup was as easy as I had hoped for. The sound support when listening to movies is outstanding. The sub adds exactly what I was hoping for: crisp, powerful deep ends without ever being overwhelmed with the performance of the XQ5s. I keep changing the set  up when listening to pure music. Most songs eg Jack Johnson in between dreams nicely work with the sub. However, more rock genres, I prefer w/o the sub. 
All in all , I absolutely enjoy this sub. Perfect match to a higher end set up, especially if you enjoy a high build quality and finish to show off in your living space. I recommend this product. ",P
8646,1200,Sensational IEM's!!,"I will eventually post a full review on my audio blog, but for now, I think these are a steal. They throw a huge soundstage, have a dreamy, smooth upper register and a gargantuan low and when called for. Just tremendous, especially for the price – so much so that I am going to buy a second pair just to have on hand.",P

Sound is now ... Crisp ... Brilliant ... Full  !
Great Decision !
",P
8651,1177,Awesome Speaker,"I was looking for some small speakers at affordable price with great sound. The Black Friday sale that KEF had on the e305 speaker system was great. I bought set of speakers   for 500.00 and ithey are worth every penny of it.
For small speakers the sound quality is amazing. I would recommend  kef to all me friend.",P

8656,1355,High quality all around,"Very impressive speakers. I was on the fence about taking the plunge and spending CA $1500+ on these speakers. I had been using the Q100 bookshelf speakers prior to purchasing these - which were very good for the price point. It wasn't until I had demoed these at a local dealer when I really discovered the clarity and dynamic sound reproduction of the LS50's - Something you have to hear for yourself! Very impressive build quality, great design and quality finish. ",P
8657,1162,Outstanding: Q300 in Linear White; paired with NAD 3020,"Q300 paired with NAD 3020, Project Debut Carbon Espirit SB DC, Apple Airport Express, Apple Mac Mini headless/USB, and Yamaha YST- SW012 sub. This a sweet spot for price vs quality. The Q300 speakers really open up the potential of the NAD 3020. There was nothing in this price range, this size, this quality finish, these color options that a none audiophile can just ""plug and play"" with a entry level system like the NAD 3020 and deliver such incredible performance. ",P
8659,1163,"Gorgeous, nice sounding bookshelf","Solid build. Attached mounting bracket sturdy. Sounds great.

Bass is a little lacking but to be expected from a bookshelf. Sound is crisp and clear. Easily fills an open 1200sqft room with 12ft ceilings. Only problem is these seem a bit power hungry, so I'll be throwing out a bit more cash than I expected to upgrade my amp.

The white finish looks super slick, especially with the covers off. I was worried it would be a tacky wood grain but it is a nice, finely-textured finish.",P
8660,1175,Worth every penny,"Was initially in the market for a 5.1 ch home theatre speaker bundle with a budget of a little under $1,000. I've had a set of 5.1ch speakers before which were about half the price of the T-205
and was very happy with them... up until now.

The T-205 was everything I expected and more. The box package that these speakers came in were no joke - it was padded all over to prevent any damage in transit. Unboxing these things you'd quickly realize
the supreme build quality of the speakers as well as the wall mount that came with it. It was obvious KEF did not cut corners when manufacturing them. The form factor on the speakers are amazingly thin and look really 
good when mounted on a wall, which actually made the build quality more impressive considering most things wouldn't feel like it's well stocked if they were thin and low profile.

The sound quality took the cake here for me, as it sounded like one of the very expensive home theatre sets you hear in the magnolia room in a local best buy but the T-205 costs way less than some of the ones there.
It has a very cinema like sound and feel to it , almost something I've grown out of expecting having owned numerous home theatre speakers before. God knows how much better these things will sound when you actually sound proof your walls.

All in all, I've never felt this excited since unboxing and getting my first ever Apple Iphone. Everything from the feel of the build quality, aesthetics and look, all the way down to how these speakers perform will blow your socks off",P
8661,1144,Exceeded expectations,"My initial LS50 pair was purchased for stereo music but was more recently called upon to double duty with our home theater system in a large room. The replacement of another brand's center speaker with a third LS50  made all the difference. With a decent home theater receiver (Yamaha RX-A2050 rated 140w/8ohm/0.06 THD) I can notice the difference from my dedicated stereo amplifier, but it's less marked than I expected. Along with a good subwoofer we can fill the room with incredible sound for movies as well as music. All of the benefits of the LS50 are evident in this setting as well---clarity, precision and detail, imaging, and presence. It's wonderful. I am wondering when I will give in and purchase another set for rear speakers. Maybe overkill, but still...maybe...",P

I listened to a Metropolitan Opera 5.1 DVD of Rossini's SEMIRAMIDE and was amazed at the detail and clarity from the new system.  I have had Kef speakers around in one form or another for over 35 years, and the sound is simply excellent.  The new set-up is great, too, for explosions and the like in Star Trek and other adventure movies, but for music it is especially wonderful.",P

After a lot of searching, I was settles on a different brand, mainly due to cost. Then KEF was kind enough to put these on sale. The sale price was still a little more than my previous choice, but considering the level up in quality I took a chance.

Sure glad I did. First record I played was Cleopatra by the Lumineers. I was blown away by how much more I could pick up through these tiny speakers, and I've seen them live! I think the mid-range on these speakers are top notch. If you are looking for a lot of bass, which I was not, these may not be for you, or add a sub. At 299 you would have to be the biggest audiophile snob to not be impressed by what KEF has done here. I have a small extra bedroom set up as a music room, and these speakers fill it perfectly. Again, you couldn't go wrong with these speakers if you were starved for space. Build quality is great. Speakers are solid, very nice finish for this price point, and I thought heavy for their size. The Q100 is a versatile speaker, and I would recommend it highly for music, high end computer speakers, satellites on a home theater.",P
8666,1199,A good substitute for Bose,"As Bose no longer makes on ear headphones, Keff is the next best thing. Had some issues with comfort. I found I couldn't wear the headband on top of my head but had to adjust the angle more towards the back of my head with the pads not resting directly on my ears. Overall, worthy substitute for the Bose SoundTrue.",P
8668,1163,"Update to my earlier ""Not as good as anticipated"" review","In my earlier review, I gave the speakers 3 stars in sound quality and recommendation.  Since then, I've upgraded the amplification driving the speakers, and the lows now come through much better.  More importantly, the kids don't seem boomy, they seem clear.  I am now as impressed as I'd hoped and anticipated.  Excellent value when on sale, and definitely a worthy consideration at full price.",P
8691,1475,Great product that fits perfectly,"Not sure why sound quality is something to rate for a case, but ...  this product does work and fit with the quality of the speaker itself very well.

8712,1152,These speakers do not disappoint!,After lots of reviews I decided on the R300's as a major speaker upgrade in a fairly large room. They did not disappoint me in any aspect. Beautiful sound that will be music to your ears!  A beautiful build all around. The sound clarity is exceptional and more than enough bass for my taste.  Can't wait to review my entire music collection!,P
8719,1177,Replaced audiophile brand soundbar with the system and couldn't be happier,"Took advantage of a great discount on Kefdirect.com  and took the plunge with this set of speakers.  I have an oddly shaped room and required a small set of speakers and these fit the bill. . I've been listening to them for a few weeks now and I think I'm happier with the sound than my wife is with how beautiful the speakers look.  It's easy to set up, extremely well built and I would highly recommend.",P
8723,1162,A new addition to the family,"Due to the excellent price I have purchased 2 pairs of Q300s in order to upgrade my surround speakers from some older Q Series speakers . They now join my Q900s and Q600c for a 7.1 setup and I couldn't be happier. I have owned KEF speakers for a over 20 years and they have never let me down. These are no different - I would rather stay at home and watch a movie with my new setup! I use them for music and movies and love all genres. The sound stage these speakers create is second to none and so easy to position. I also really like the sleek look - simple, modern and sturdy. Next up a KEF sub-woofer : ) ",P
8724,1162,"Great sound, surprised by the price","When I placed the order I was bit skeptical about the speakers, just because of the lower price. There was no showroom or agent I could find in NC to audition the speakers. I have paired Q300s with a Marantz 5011 AVR and I have bi-amp the speakers. I am very impressed with the sound quality. I am not going to comparer any other brands. I think Speakers are like food. People have their own preferences, taste and allergies. I feel the speakers are bit shy on bass and those require a sub (or two). If your main focus is home theater, then these require sub woofers for sure.
I am sure pairing the speakers with a power amp will improve the sound quality more, which I am planning to do soon. If you are planning to buy set of speakers, I think Q300 is a very good contender. My strategy was to find a good pair of speakers without breaking the bank, so I can equally invest in rest of the core components to make the sound system function optimally. I think I have achieved it with this purchase.",P
8725,1165,Great center channel,"Not only is the sound quality fantastic, the speaker looks amazing in my living room.",P
8726,1159,As ASUME as the other KEF Speakers I own,A little missing in the bass at first but now that they are broke in the bass is there. Still would suggest a good sub woofer for the low in. I own KEF outdoor speakers and desk top speakers with a pair of the 100's on my computer. All are worth way more then what they cost.,
8827,1174,Great product,"Great speaker stands, very slick design and good quality",P
8828,1498,Amazing IEM's!," When these went on sale, I grabbed them – at $69, they are an astonishing bargain.  Even at the retail price of $200, they are a great value. 
Although it takes a little getting used to getting them to fit properly, the sound of the M200's, from the deep bass to the highest highs, is smooth, even and wonderful. These also produce an amazing, huge  soundstage for a pair of in ear monitors. I just can't recommend these highly enough!

",P
8829,1498,Very good bargain,"I listen mostly to classical music and found the earphones surprisingly good for in-ear phones.  Excellent midrange, good treble and fair bass.  Faithful sound.  Overall it us a true sound with nothing accentuated.  For the very best sound I prefer the M500 headphones.  But if you are on the go or away from home these earphones are a very enjoyable alternative.",P
8830,1498,High quality build typical of KEF products.,Sounds very good provided the fit allows the ear buds to seal.,P
8831,1498,Wonderful sound,"Fast delivery, product looks really good replicate sound very good specially low range and bass, good fit with the different ear plugs, it also shows  noice control ",P
8832,1495,Good purchase,Overall pleased.,P
8833,1163,Kef speakers rule,I own a pair of LS50 that I purchased about 6 months agoing every day I am amazed at the sound stage of these speakers decided to buy. Pair of Q100 for my son for Xmas they are great he drive them with a small 8 watt tube amp with out spending a lot more and I am talking a lot more for a bookshelf speaker,P
8834,1167,Great,Absolutely fantastic,P
8835,1163,"Great value, outstanding sound","I was a little leary with getting such a small speaker and expecting the sound people online were saying I should expect. Well once again, as is often the case with my wife, I was wrong. These speakers stand up to any of their bigger brothers, sound very clear, precise and their sound field as advertised is excellent. Being a long time B&W speaker owner I may be converted. 

I'm using them in an IKEA bookshelf in our large living room as a source of background music running as a second zone on my Yamaha 677 receiver. Excellent buy.",P
8836,1143,UNBELIEVABLE !!!,"Has these now about 6 weeks --- I am blown away with their sound.
Soundstage incredible, they compete with speakers 10x the cost and 10x the size !!
Listening mainly to classical with Vintage Cyrus equipment and believe me these needs to be heard to be believed.
Kudos KEF on one amazing product.",P
8837,1167,Great closed subwoofer for nice response and tone,"I have the Q400b mated with my Q100s and a Marantz PM6005 receiver/amp. 
I'm using high level inputs on the Q400b which has a small adapter for a secure speaker wire connection and easy removal.
There was a ground loop in my system which caused hum from the sub, but grounding the receiver chassis to one of the screws on the back of the sub worked wonders.

The sound from the sub is very nice. Controlled tight response and good mids blend very well with the smaller bookshelves. 
The crossover, volume, and bass boost on the sub make it easy to find the sweet spot with your other speakers.
This will not dig as deep as you would need for a good home theater experience, but that's what you'd expect from a 10"" closed box design.

The finish of the enclosure and quality of the knobs and switches on the back are quite good.
The matte look of the front matches the rest of the Q series and makes a very sophisticated looking system.",P
8838,1167,Nice speakers,"After several weeks of research on the web and talking to my brother who has been building stereo systems including speaker enclosures  for 40 years, I decided to go with KEF. I purchased Q300's and the Q400 sub-woofer. To me, the sound is wonderful, much nicer than my previous system. During a visit, my brother commented the speakers are really nice sounding which was nice to hear. He is very picky about his music and audio systems.",P
8839,1261,I shouldn't have to buy these.,"I love my headphones, they look and sound awesome, but the build quality has been terrible. Both earpads came apart and I had to order these replacements. I hope these last longer than the original. But I should not have to order these. Im at a loss as to why people are giving 5 stars for replacement parts for something that is faulty. I own many headphones for extended periods of time and the ear pads have never fallen apart.

One other thing, I hope KEF allows people from Australia to order these as I had to use a 3rd party to ship these to me and the shipping cost was twice the price of these replacement parts.",N
8840,1264,best speakers for home theater,"bought these wondering how it is how to perform given its size.
to my surprise these set of speakers are far better than my current panasonic speakers.
No noise. crystal clear sound. And center speaker is awesome. 
I am really happy with T105  system.",P
8843,1264,Love the speaker But..,"The speakers looks great and sounds is great.   However, I wish the subwoofer would have an option to stay-on without going to standby mode or have lower threshold to go into standby mode.   When I use the system in the evening with the volume set slightly lower while the sound source also have low volume, the subwoofer will go into standby mode.  I have tried various settings in the receiver to reduce the issue, but I am yet to be able to completely eliminate it.   It works great if the volume is set to 50% or more on the reciever. ",A
8846,1161,Quick shipping,"Even though they were on back order when I ordered them during Christmas time, they came before the New Year. I have an older Q15.2 pair, and compare to them, I noticed more details in the low frequencies. Of course, I have not spent a lot time listening and can not provide a comprehensive review. The overall purchase was smooth.",P
8847,1264,Home Theater At It's Finest,The speakers are high quality and sound is surrealistic! Though I was skeptical about the sound quality in such a small speaker but it failed to NOT amaze me! Great product and great price. I recommend this to everyone.,P
8850,1175,Best purchase of 2016!,"The KEF T205 5.1 speakers might be my best purchase of 2016. These are simply fantastic sounding speakers. We moved to a new house and the wife refused to let me purchase floor standing speakers (i had my eyes set on ELAC Debut). Found the KEF T205 at a great price and pulled the trigger. The sound is amazing for such thin and compact speakers. I set the crossover for the T2 subwoofer down to 120Hz, as stated in the manual, and the sound is simply outstanding. I have an open floor plan and was really concerned if these speakers would deliver, but they live up well to their reputation. I played the bank robbery scene from The Dark Knight and my floor really shakes. Highly recommended!",P
8851,1143,I love these speakers and I find myself listening to music many more hours a day just to hear how great they sound.,"What I find most impressive about the LS50s is their combination of warmth and clarity across a broad sonic range. I have combined a Sprout amplifier and together they provide high quality at a reasonable price. I listen to a lot of jazz and the LS50s do a a great job of handling the sylistic nuances of the horns and keyboards but what knocks me is the way they capture the full range of the drum kit. They also do a great job on the upright bass, with a strong, full, yet tight sound, that avoids boominess. I recommend them without reservation.",P
8852,1159,Outstanding for the price!,I recently bought the Q900 in the Walnut finish.  Delivery was fast. No damage ( heard they chipped easily ). Build quality seems excellent for what it is. Sound quality is outstanding! I very highly recommend these speakers especially at the discounted price. Don't think you could find a better deal on a pair of speakers of this quality.,P
8853,1350,Great soundstage,"Clear, balanced, warm sounding speakers that have exceeded my expectations.",P
8854,1342,M  100,"I Love the fact I have the choices of ear  piece sizers. Bravo, an ear piece that stays put.  The pouch is convenient and keeps major tangles  less of a problem. The sound is crisp and clean tho  presence is a little weak. I have phenomenal hearing for my age and I have to squeeze the smart phone volume close to max to get much of the sound out without pounding decibels into the inner workings  of the ears. The ear buds themselves have a little heft so you know they are there and not easily falling out like cheap stuff does. I m not a  BIG  ear bud fan since I am an audiophile and only do i use them for personal listening.  For an hundred bucks, they are a reasonable value. I have owned KEF  speakers for 30 yrs. Those Old KEF reference and the first UniQ's still pack a wallop of  clean sound. Maybe I was expecting that with the ear buds!",
8856,1162,Amazing Sound! Amazing Price! Highly Recommended!,"As a KEF owner, 25 years and counting, through multiple series of the Q-Series family, I am never surprised, but continue to be amazed at the balance of high quality sound and cost the Q-Series brings.  This Christmas I decided to build a simple 2-channel audio system, bringing together a Marantz MM 7025 Amplifier, a direct attached Cambridge CXN Music Player and DAC and of course KEF Q-Series speakers.  Initially I started with an older generation, pair of KEF Q-10's, in the system and quickly realized that with KEF's attractive holiday pricing, it was time to upgrade.   Don't get me wrong, the Q10's shine, but I elected that after 20 years it was time to upgrade to the Q300 and the decision was not only right, but truly an amazing step up!  Detail, Bass and imaging, all the quality's of a truly great sound experience exploded in front of me out of the box.

I now have a home theatre with Q-Series surround sound, Q700 and Q600 and now a new audio only system with the Q300's!  I'll never look back or change course in the future.  Keep up the great work KEF!",
8857,1350,Amazing Sound,"For a desk top speaker, the sound is truly amazing! When using the USB connection to my Mac, Hi-Rez files from Tidal have a very spacious detailed sound.  No other desk top speaker I've owned sound as good.  Well worth the purchase.",
8859,1235,The C4 that Could - Part 2,"Feel the same as C4 review by ArmSC - this C4 puts out a lot of clean bass for a smaller 8"" sub.  I have mine in a larger room and it easily fills the room with tight and controlled bass at about 40% volume.  Also very impressed.  I have it paired with the KEF FiveTwo Series 7 speakers and they're an excellent match together.  For my main family room system, I have a SVS PB-2000 sub with a 12"" inch driver and 500 watt amp, which is an awesome and deep hitting sub, but still impressed with the output of the C4 in comparison and how it blends seamlessly with my FiveTwo speakers.   Definitely recommend and KEF speakers in general!  ",
8860,1264,Great buy-exactly what I'd been looking for,The build on these speakers are awesome.  Nothing extraneous.   Installation was very easy.  These are truly a slim line speaker which do not protrude past my 2016 wall mounted 4K TV.  Sound is clear and strong.  They are not broken in yet but I expect they'll only get better.  I would highly recommend these speakers if you're looking for something that won't mount past the surface of the TV.,
8861,1159,"They look magnificent, and sound to match. The definition of each instrment is so clear, and the dynamic range is marvelous.","I've been familiar with KEF speakers for years, having grown up in the UK. These Q900s exceed my expectations. I couldn't be more pleased with the dynamic range and the definition of each instrument is so clear. They are a great match for my Adcom 200W per channel amplifier and have ended my long search for just the right speakers.",
8865,1162,Remarkable!,"I have a pair of LS50s I absolutely love, but wanted an additional pair of speakers for TV viewing, as the Q series have similar looking drivers I though I'd try them. WOW, definitely quite a family resemblance in sound quality! For a fraction of the price these are awesome, particularly when on sale!",
8866,1162,Best speakers I have ever owned!!!,"Took a chance on these via the many positive reviews. After about 140 hours of break in, they are crystal clear, needing very minmal power to make them sing. My wife loved the linear white, and also said these are so much clearer than my Polks. I am going to complete my 5.1 setup wth a center channel and surrounds from Kef. But to be honest the 2.0 setup is more than spectacular even with movies. I am very pleased with Kef and am glad that I took a chance on them.",
8867,1350,GOOD  SOUND AND VALUE FOR THE MONEY,KEF EGG speakers have that good integrated sound given the point source arrangement.   Very good as a replacement for TV speakers for both TV watching and streaming that much improves the sound especially for voice clarity.    Lacking in bass but not surprising given their size and design.    Only downside I found so far is that the remote is slow to respond and doesn't pick up signals from a distance across a slightly larger room.   I got the units with brilliant blue finish which looks rather classy.,
8868,1175,They deliver,"1st world problems.  We moved, and the DefTech Mythos XTR-60s & XTR-20BP were not up to snuff for my wife because they were black and our new living room is light grey.  She actually found these and they blend in really well.   They are slim and very well built.  I added in the Ci200ER In-Ceiling Speaker Ultra Thin Bezel for my Atmos setup and I am pretty happy with the the look and the sound quality.

While the sound quality is good, I would say that  the DefTech has more punch, but it is also 2x the price and has more drivers.  The subwoofer has less punch as well but these are slimmer than my Mythos  and definitely more cost effective- so very high marks for value",
8869,1474,"Great Sound, Bad User Experience","Well, I am avoiding describing the audio quality as there will be plenty of audiophile reviews.

My biggest concern with these speakers is User Experience. While claiming that these speakers are Wireless, it seems KEF killed such an important feature as auto wake up if signal is coming into any of the inputs. This feature greatly worked in KEF X300A Wireless. You could just start streaming something with AirPlay or AUX and speakers would turn on and start playing. These are silent dead! Until you find a remote control to turn them on, or if you will make a round trip to the end of the room to press the ON button on top of the left speaker. Seriously?! And this is every other hour, as it seems speakers go sleep after an hour or so of not playing.

I am not sure if KEF is about to address this in some firmware update, as it seems they introduced this silly ON button on the speaker and on the remote control to remind you that you are still on the planet Earth and you must to suffer a bit while enjoying the heaven class audio quality.

P.S. One of the possible solutions would be at least turn on speakers if Volume Up/Down signal is sent from IR Remote. As you can program you Apple TV 4 Remote to control volume of these speakers at the moment.",
8870,1161,Lived up to the hype,"I had done a bit of research on these speakers and most reviews raved about the detail and stereo imaging. Happy to say these speakers did not disappoint. I'm hearing things on recordings that I've never noticed before. 
The bass response is not overpowering, but I'm using the speakers temporarily in a large living room. For the type of music I'm listening to now they do very well. 
",
8871,1162,KEF Q300 Bookshelf Speakers,"First off I set out to purchase a pair of 2.0 setup.  I have had all the 7.2 setup.  I'm 60 years old, and it all boils down too the simplicity of it all.  I stated out with a list of 10 bookshelf speakers and many above the price of KEF Q 300. I auditioned many of the 10 pairs.  These KEF 300s are worth much more than their modest price.  I will tell you this I'm buying another pair very soon.  I will and would like to say the bass and mid range and treble with tone control sound absolutely awesome.  With tone controls on my Rotel RA- 985bx she drive these Q300 very well.  I have always been amazed with these speakers from the get go. I will in closing say the speakers blow speakers many times their value and still win.    Thank you KEF I am a very proud owner      Keith",
8872,1163,"Great speakers, Great price","I was in the market for a new set of bookshelf speakers and I had read a ton great reviews for these guys.  All the reviews are spot on!  These speakers put out great sound, especially for music enjoyment.  They are situated in a 20' X 15' living room and they put out plenty of volume to fill the space.  The walnut finish is beautiful; goes perfectly with my dark wood furniture.  For the price, you won't find a better set of speakers.  I couldn't be happier with my purchase and would recommend these speakers without reservation!",
8873,1167,Well done,"Beautifully crafted, great sounding, easy to integrate",
8874,1163,Great value and great sound,"Bought these on sale about 2-3 months ago.  They are getting better by the week as they are broken in.  Good bass for the speaker size.  Great clarity and mids.  Thinking of upgrading in the future to an R series speaker, which if these are any indication, will be an even better decision.  Really like KEF and their products.",
8875,1350,Almost perfect Desktop sound,"Very high quality speakers. Bought them during boxing day and that may affect my review. At this price I am really happy. It's not a wow reaction, it's the feeling I have over time listening to the music coming out of those speakers, the definition of the sound, its warmth, the image, I really like them.",
8876,1163,"Great sound, great price, and good lookin' to boot!","Maybe this is not everyone's criteria, but when I started looking for speakers for my small  studio apartment, they needed to not only perform, but look good while doing so. Aesthetics are important to my eyes and my ears, especially since I spent the past year remodeling my home into a mid-century modern wonderland.  These speakers did not disappoint.  The sound is incredible, and the linear white speakers look right at home with the surrounding decor.  Thanks KEF!",
8877,1165,KEF all the way!,Bought these as a requested gift for my son. He is very happy with this purchase. Goes perfectly with his bookshelf KEF speakers.,
8879,1474,KEF LS50 wireless brings audiophile-grade sound into the modern home,"I recently purchased the LS50 wireless in white / copper. The speakers look great, have superior build quality  and they feel very solid. They are super heavy and barely vibrate when in use (which is a great when placed on a desk). The setup experience was super easy (as it should be) with the desk/stand, wall/free space options. Sound quality is everything you would expect from a pair of high end speakers - The rich and deep sound is nothing but spectacular. When not in use, these speakers power themselves off automatically. Highly recommend these speakers if you are looking to invest in audiophile speakers without having to think about the complexity and intrusive physical footprint of a multi-component sound system.

In terms of improvements, I hope that KEF provides a way to wake up the speakers when music is streamed vs. having to turn on manually on the speaker or using the remote. In a future version of the product, it would be great if the speakers could be wirelessly linked to each other instead of the CAT cable connection.",
8880,1165,Incredible 3-way sound for center,"The build quality is top notch for the price range, especially when you examine the speakers themselves. 
My previous center just couldn't match the performance of my 2 KEF Q100s fronts, 200c is perfect for my setup and the size isn't obnoxious either.  
The main stand-out for me is this is a full 3-way speaker for a center! For this price range nothing offers the same level of performance. ",
8881,1165,3-way speaker for center!,"I am very pleased with this speaker selection. It performs incredibly well and its the only 3-way center channel for this price range. 
Nothing came close this performance in my research. It played a big role in my purchase of KEF Q-system over ELAC",
8882,1474,Award Speaking Speakers Taken To The Next Level,"I am a previous owner of the KEF LS50 speakers which were already one of, if not the best, speakers in their original price range ($1500).  Well these speakers improve on just about everything with those and actually prove to be a better value now that you don't need to worry about an Amplifier, DAC or Network Streamer if you don't want too. And the way the Amp/DAC are implemented I can say that you probably won't want too. I tried multiple different amp/DAC pairings with my original LS50's and nothing sounded as good as these custom built one's do. Musicality is through the roof on these bad boys, they quite simply sound fantastic. 

If I was to nitpick anything I would have to say the Network Streaming is a bit lacking in terms of user interface, as well as the ability to use TIDAL streaming, which was a deal breaker for me. Easy enough fix though, I just hooked up an Auralic Aries Mini as my streamer, picking up TIDAL in the process as well as a better UI and slightly improved sound quality. Not necessary, but I would recommend something like the Aries or even a Sonore MicroRendu if you're serious about your hi-fi. If they do end up implementing TIDAL streaming (and Roon for that matter), then these would literally be perfect. A job well done by KEF, and a speaker that seriously takes hi-fi to another level for a very modest price.",
8883,1474,"Breathtaking Sound, But Not Really ""Wireless.""","I received these speakers via Fedex a few days ago after waiting since November for their official release month of January, 2017. They sound amazing, but my problem is not with the sound, but with the interface.

I read a few reviews online prior to their arrival (but unfortunately after I ordered them) that the speakers can't play (can't even see on my hard drive) SACD-ISO, DSD64 or DSD128 files - only a max-24bit/192kHz file. That may be what the KEF app can play, but I'm here to tell you that I play SACD files through Audirvana Plus just fine, and they sound amazing on these speakers. The manufacturer was so surprised when I told them I was able to get them to work that they emailed me twice with requests for details.

Here's the issue I have - you CAN play music via WiFi thru your phone, but not from a computer or laptop. I'm left with having to connect a USB cable from my laptop to the speakers - very unsightly and cumbersome. Their support team told me that I could stream via Bluetooth, but there would be a loss in quality.

Again, they sound amazing thru my USB setup, but I am hoping that A) KEF acknowledges that you CAN play SACD-ISO files using the right software, and B) solve the problem of WiFi interaction with computers, so audiophiles (the intended audience at this price-point) can stream their high-res files without clumsy cables. They are not truly ""wireless speakers"" because they are wired to each other, wired to their respective electrical outlets, and now, unfortunately wired to my computer.



________________

From KEF:

The KEF LS50W uses PCM audio for playback and similar to most other playback devices and platforms, users wishing to stream DSD/SACD audio must first convert the audio from DSD to PCM. This is accomplished via a menu selection in the playback program. For example, in Audivarna, as per their user manual (pg. 34,35), the user must select either 64-bit decimation or 64-bit multistage to convert the DSD audio signal to PCM before sending to the DACs. You absolutely stream DSD files to the LS50W as long as your server/host converts the file to PCM first, so therefore technically, you are playing files converted from DSD to PCM rather than playing straight DSD.

The KEF LS50W supports DLNA streaming, but it does not support Apple Airplay. You can stream audio from your DLNA-enabled device such as a PC or laptop but you will need an Airport Express (for example) to stream from a MAC to the LS50W. DLNA is the world-wide standard for non-Apple manufactured audio/video streaming and connection, and Apple has produced products such as the AirPort Express for this express purpose. 

Because of the necessity in having as precise a clock as possible to sync the left and right channels for phase-correct output and to reduce other issues caused by imprecise clocking, the clock generated in the master speaker as well as the audio data, is transmitted via a CAT6 cable. In order to provide as high quality an output as possible, there are separate amplifier and DSP sets in each speaker, because of this each speaker requires its own AC power source as well. As a result of our desire to make LS50W an extremely high-end active music system, the system is wireless, but the speakers within the system, by necessity, are not.",
8884,1162,Impressive for Size,Home theater application in room with lots of glass and half rear wall.  Room size is approximately 25 wide by 20 deep.  Speakers do an excellent job warming the sound and filling holes that I didn't realize I had from replaced larger speakers.  Impressed with performance.  I purchased on sale so I'm reluctant to give 5 stars as a recommendation when retail was $650.,
8885,1163,Great speakers,The sound stage from these speakers is simply amazing and very well balanced.  I mounted my Q100s on the wall in my kitchen using the built-in bracket which made things so easy.  I am driving them with a Rotel CD player and preamp into an Adcom poweramp.  I am very happy!,
8887,1165,Great sounding speaker,"Very crisp sound coming out of the speaker.  Definitely a larger center channel, but stays clear at high volumes and looks great as well.",
8888,1162,Fantastic Speakers,"Very crisp sounding speakers with punchy highs and clean bass.  For a speaker of its size, it handles loud volumes very well and stays clear in the process.  Looks great too (Walnut Finish).",

8891,1474,Amazing sound but features need help,"Really great sound.
Terrible remote.
Needs auto switching of sources, ability to use phone app instead of remote,  and Airplay.  There is really no good reason not to have airplay on these as bluetooth has much worse sound quality.
Roon and MQA integration would be really nice.",
8894,1176,Surprisingly powerful,"This was my first home theater purchase so I will put NOT an audiophile disclaimer. 

After a good amount of reading and strong recommendation from an audiophile friend, I zeroed in on this speaker set against my original desire of opting for the better marketed  B brand. 

Speakers were delivered promptly and I was surprised to find no cables inside( read disclaimer). 

Anyways, buying these speakers was an awesome decision. Speakers were a breeze to set up along with Marantz 5010. They look stunning on the walls and with such a small form factor, they have managed to not make my living room look bulky or over crowded. 

After the original set up, I switched them on and they sounded like ordinary speakers at first. It's when I started looking at some settings and increased the volume then I realized the beast I have unleashed. The speakers transformed my whole music and movie experience. Upto volume 60 there is no visible difference between TV speakers and these. Only when I increased the volume 60 onwards, they were truly able to deliver upto their capability. Most surprising part was the sub. For such a tiny box, it sure shaked my whole household. 

Settings of the receiver are a must to explore. If you are not getting the sound you expect, play with settings. 

Very pleased with purchase and highly recommend this speaker set. ",
8895,1162,True Audiophile experience,"In my opinion, in my listening room, the Q300's outperform some quality European competition in the
$2000-$3000 price range. The combination of the concentric drivers, front porting and efficiency allow the 
soundstage to flow freely in my room. I mainly play LP's and my system, not including the KEF's, this Analog
Rig is beyond a $20k investment. You could easily spend $1800 and not get the quality of sound provided by 
the KEF Q300's. A no brainer, stone cold bargin.",
8896,1177,Great sound.,"Small and stylish so you can put them anywhere. Sound is as good as it gets. Would definitely buy again, especially at the sale price of $599.",
8897,1162,Very impressed.,"Almost finished breaking these in and I'm nothing short of amazed.  I used to have their rivals, the B&W 685's hooked up to a NAD C-352 amp and they sounded great until one of the woofers went out.  I stumbled upon these while looking for replacements and figured I'd give them a try because they were on sale and I'm so glad I did.  Some mention the bass is more substantial on the 685's but I think it's the opposite.  The lower end is more satisfying from these and when cranking up the volume to get the voice coils flexing I found I had to put the plugs in the port tubes to get them really moving.  These put out equal or better sound and are capable of putting out far more sound than the B&W's ever could.  They definitely sound much larger than they are.",
8898,1163,Outstanding,"I have built in ""bookshelves"" wher I need to place my speakers. The versatility of the Q100s were the solution to my placement issue. I love them. Some reviews I read said that these speakers need to break in before they are at their best?  If that is the case I can't wait to hrear them a month from now. They are outstanding now!",
8899,1261,Replacement Ear Pads,"Bought the M500s when they came  and I'm now just replacing the ear pads.  Excellent quality, easy to replace, and I can happily listen to one of my favorite portable over ear headphones again.",
8902,1162,"Got the Q300.  Special Offer, Just received them.","Got a pair of Q300 last week. Just finished setting them up.

Still breaking in the Q300. So far the Mid's are very clear, Bass is good for a 6.5 woofer. I had to tame the high's a bit
for my taste.

Will have to wait and hear them after 80-100 hrs. Still intrigued by the concentric speaker design. Looks are outstanding.
Priced at $ 399.00 with a special offer from KEF makes them a good buy. They replace a Pair of Dynaudio BM  5A. 
Shipping was fast, good packing , instructions. 

Happy listening. Cheers!!!

8903,1474,IMHO These are a complete Audiophile Grade Listening Solution,"There are plenty of reviews  that are positive, so in  my  perspective, LS50 Wireless are outstanding clarity, air, sparkle, depth, bass (extended option,) naturalness of voices, punch, impact.  Tremendous ability to fill out a medium sized living room, with beautiful deep sound for the times you want to experience the music as if live, or relax with it in the quiet of the evening.  In the 70's I had a mega watt, floor standing high end Bose, large equipment rack and radial turntable.  I can let it all go, without feeling like I have stepped down in anyway.  For years I have been into some extremely high-end digital audio with Headphones, matching headphones cables, amps, DACs and pristine resolution files, and these stack up very well, for an open audio system. I could just use the system as is, BUT in my situation I needed to have longer power cords (3m), and audio speaker interconnect, (5m)  for my set-up so I did change them and upgrade, BUT otherwise did not feel the need.  For power cords I picked a 14GA basic audio level power cord, and for speaker interconnect, I chose a Cat 7 cable, though Cat 6, should be fine.   KEF stands are not available at this time, so I chose one with a 61/2 x 8 top plate in the $200. range, but also used an Aperta isolator, popping off the rubber speaker feet.  I also added a AC line filter box, because I don't have other home theatre equipment causing me to go beyond a basic surge protector.  I've spent weeks making these choices, so I hope this may help someone else.  I did check with KEF support, and they recommended a speaker stand top plate of 7x8 minimum, and stands which are fillable with a dampening material.  I enjoy listening to them in extended bass setting, and they advised they can be used this way 100% of the time without damage.  They also said ""You will definitely notice more bass after the break in period. The breaking period will occur between 120 or 140 hours of use. The drivers will completely open up.""  Hope this helps others!  My stands are 24 inch, and with the Aperta, the height is 27 inches.  KEF support thought anywhere between 18-28 inches height is fine.  Finally i do notice a improvement in using a good source wired with a a good line out (3.v vs 1.V).  Wireless is excellent jus the app still needs to improve.",
8904,1163,Fantastic speaker,Paired this with a sonos amp and a Audio Technica LP120. Crystal clear sounds. Amazing quality.,
8905,1261,M500 Ear Pad,Customer service was thoughtful and caring about my ear pad leather coming apart. That's nice to see these days! Hopefully these will last longer then the original ear pads. They do seem to be well made. Their soft leather is comfortable to wear. My three stars is only because the first ones should not have split.,
8906,1161,nice,"These are very nice. I have them in the front on a 7.1 system: Kef Q series speakers, SVS sub, Onkyo NX R 474 multi channel receiver.  There is a definite break in period with the Q500 speakers (100 hours), but after the break in,  I tuned my system for about 3 days, and when I got it setup right,  the Kef Q500 series speakers are among the best  that I have ever own, and have owned ultra high products in the past.  I bought a pair of q700s as well. The Q700 speakers obviously have a lower end response than the Q500 speakers, but I believe the Q500 have better midrange.  Most people would buy the Q700 over the Q500 because the Q700 are fuller and easier to setup.   Both are great products.",
8907,1176,extremely happy with purchase,"I was able to incorporate a new home theater setup into the wife's remodel plans for the room above the garage, and the T305 fit perfectly. Paired with a Sony XBR65X930D display, and a Marantz SR6011 I was able to achieve the delicate balance of wife pleasing aesthetics with sound that seems much greater than the enclosure size would have you believe.

I was limited in options based upon aesthetics, and  auditioned other brands slim solutions in the $2-3K price range, but they unfortunately sounded as flat as their profiles. With the closest KEF dealer 100 miles away, I purchased based solely on the reviews I could find, and prayed for the best. I am happy to say that I was not let down. The build quality is exceptional when compared to other offerings in this price range. The wall mounts are well constructed, and made mounting a breeze.

The sound is good at low volume, but they really seem to open up once the volume is increased, which is perfect for the home theater environment. I ended up adding two pair of KEF Ci160ER in-ceiling speakers for an Atmos 5.1.4 setup,  They are tonally matched, and provide an incredibly immersive experience for a very reasonable price.",
8908,1163,Best speakers at this price point and higher,Sound stage was big and very clear. You won't find anything better at the discounted price.,
8910,1162,Game changer!,"These speakers are crazy good, I have a pair of LS50s that I love, and when I got these I A/Bd them extensively to try to hear differences. They are there, but very few! The Q300 go a bit deeper, but have some minor resonances or port sounds that are absent on the LS 50s. However the Q300 is 95% performance of the LS 50 at a fraction of the price, particularly when on sale! KEF have really raised the bar for reasonably priced very high end sound bookshelves with this model. The imaging is remarkable, I feel due to the coaxial driver design. THey've really got it right with this newest version. If youy've ever heard full rangers, they also can have spooky imaging capabilities, but always lack the high end, or real bass, take you  pick. Not these babies! It's amazing the amount of bass you can get from a 6.5"" woofer! The only quibble I have with the whole new range of UniQ speakers is that they are a bit forward soundwise in the upper mid register. With well recorded material this gives them incredible life and presence, but with poorly recorded material, particularly older pop and rock recordings they can should pretty shrill. Luckily, their distortion is so low it doesn't kill you, but you do want to head for the tone controls or eq.    ",
8913,1162,q300,"I would like to see something better in the footer feet for these. The sound quality increased dramatically when based and angled upward. Lower volume can produce a flat and dead report. Some power is required to produce full tone and quality.  I have tried these with power amped to the 8 ohm and dual amped using the four ohm posts.  No noticeable difference is found by myself. I would like to see a banana plug connects on the binding post. Although the low end is missing what a eight inch speaker can produce there is still a punch. Overall the sound made by q300 is rich and full beyond what units costing twice as much do. Voice is clear and present an accurate representation of living sound, stings are deep and rich, brass and wind are fluent but can be whiney in the top end.  I like the sound very much. ",
8914,1474,I'm very impressed!,"I purchased a pair of these from my local KEF dealer to find out if they'd impress me enough to replace my KEF LS50/integrated amp/DAC  digital audio system. I was intrigued by the idea of perfectly matched speakers/amp/DAC since I'm a firm believer in ideal synergy best being achieved by engineers who's pay grade is far above my own. I'd never buy a sports car  with an engine, electrical system, and chassis that weren't designed by one manufacturer so why should we be doing this with our audio? How do I feel about the ""me way of doing things"" after a couple of weeks of analysis? I give the LS50 Wireless a firm A+, and the last of my previous equipment sold on eBay today. I couldn't be any more pleased. Like several of the professional reviewers have said, I never heard my LS50s sound this good when powered by an external amplifier and expernal DAC.  I'll never go back!",
8915,1235,Punchy Bass,"I love this sub, it produces clear bass than my svc. Small form factor is good. ",
8916,1162,Fantastic speakers at a fantastic price,"I had intended to buy these speakers and then quickly follow this purchase with a Marantz HD-AMP1 a few weeks later. As I am not very patient I decided to try them out with a SONOS Connect:AMP that I had at home. They sound fantastic with the SONOS, so I'm now faced with ""will they sound even better than fantastic if I get the Marantz AM?"", or ""should I save myself more than $1000 and stick with what I've got?"". I am in no way of HiFi enthusiast, but would class myself as a middle aged guy wanting to treat himself to some good kit that he could't afford when he was a kid, who has a better ear than the average person  on the street. If you're that guy/girl too, then go for it, especially at the current reduced price.",
8917,1163,Incredible sounding speakers,"After doing a lot of research I ended up purchasing the Q100's  to pair with a Q200 center channel and a pair of SVS subs for my HT.  They sound so good!  It has been so long since I've had proper speakers that I've forgotten how good they can sound.  As good as they are in my HT, they sound even better for music.  All I want to do now is go down stairs and put on a movie or some music.  I honestly couldn't be happier with my purchase.  ",
8919,1423,Terrific for Atmos,"Purchased two pair to build out a 5.1.4 Atmos setup paired with KEF T305. The build quality is quite nice with very thin bezels, and installation was a breeze.

They are a nice match for the T305, and fill the room with Atmos/DTS:X soundtracks. Would highly recommend.",
8920,1159,Kef Continues the Great Tradition,"I've had all Kef speakers - in several home theaters - for over 25 years. I just upgraded to the new Q series - and I am very happy I did. Great sound - great dispersion - I had to adjust the bass t keep it down - but only small adjustments. I could not be more pleased. Thank you Kef. (PS - Yesterday, I received my Q500s. Such gorgeous, delicate sound. 2 more coming for surrounds. Can't wait!!",
8921,1164,Q600c,This speaker works perfectly with my Q900 's   I can't speak to any other combination. It replaces my Q95c which is lacking in this application. My main system is kef with 4 Reference 4 s and a Q200c so I confess to being a big Kef  fan.,
8923,1474,Great things do come in small packages,"Great build, looks, quality and sound.  Has the bass of a much bigger speaker.  The only issues (and they are minor) are that the KEF app is sporadic and I'd like to see the system turn on when it sensed a source.  ",
8926,1162,Great bookshelf speakers,"I purchased these to pair with another set of bookshelf speakers (Energy rc10) for Multichannel Stereo playback in my garage. The KEF's soundstage is excellent. Clear crisp highs and surprising low end. The more clean power put to them, the better they sound!",
8928,1487,Gravity One,"Nice Design.   Compact,   Highs sound clean.  However,  bass is not where I like it, and unless I'm mistaken, no way to adjust it.   The Bose equivalent is 100 less.  

",
8929,1155,Poor finish choices.,"The R600C sounds great, but the large size makes it difficult to place under the TV without a custom stand.
I got the gloss black finish that tends to reflex light off the screen.  Rosewood would have been much better.
The finish is well done, but still it's just paint.    Such an expensive speaker should offer more wood finishes.",N
8930,1474,Big sound from a small package!,"I'm blown away by how much and how good the sound that comes out of these little speakers is!  These are perfect for anyone looking to create a small (but with big sound) 2.0 or 2.1 system in a small to medium space!

I'm using these as my computer speakers, wired.  They simply sound amazing.  Connecting to my iPhone 7 through bluetooth there's a  step down in sound quality but nothing drastic, most people wouldn't notice the difference, unless you're an audiophile or were listening to both wired/bluetooth back to back.  Overall I'm extremely satisfied with them!

About the app, yeah....lets not talk about the app for now......it needs serious work!  This is the only negative, keep in mind this product is relatively new, I'm sure Kef will make it right in due time.  Right Kef?!?!",
8931,1165,Awesome!,"Very glad I did my homework and found these instead of just walking into a brick and mortar store and picking out something off the shelf. Build, design and sound is nothing but superb. Very happy with my sound system and so are my PS4 Pro and Xbox One S. Perfect compliment to my 7.2 system!",

8934,1162,Good quality,"As expected, a true KEF product with quality sound in mind.",
8935,1163,Sophisticated Sound,"These are my first pair of KEF's and I am very amazed by the sound. 
I tested the speakers with Denon AVR S920. If I  had to complain, the bass is a little weak, but I think it's intended to be. All the sounds are detailed and the high key is there, but it doesn't hurt my ears. it sounds very sophisticated.
Classical music sounds perfect. it blew my mind. Other types of music sound great too.
",
8940,1162,All Around Great Pair of Speakers,Crisp highs. Clean bass. If you're going to blow $400 on a pair of speakers they better look nice and these look great in a living room.,
8941,1182,Great sub for the money,"This is a great sub for the money.  i am using it with a pair of Magnepan MMGs and it blends beautifully with them.  Very musical, and easily keeps up with the lighting fast Maggies.  The adjustments for volume and crossover allow it to seamlessly blend with the speakers.

Very happy with this product.",
8943,1509,The Muo was a huge hit!,"I purchased one of these units for a friend  and she was so excited to receive it!  Once she had charged the unit and connected via Bluetooth she was amazed with its outstanding sound quality & build.  Super easy to use and never loses the wireless connection, great wireless speaker!  Also, my friend had indicated that the additional free accessories were fantastic!  Overall wonderful product and a awesome buy! Thanks Kef, your customer for life!  Darryl.",
8944,1165,Very happy,Got the Q200c set up a few weeks ago. Very happy with the results. I was replacing an old cheap thing from college and this was absolutely the right move. The vocals in movies and TV shows is amazingly clear (can easily tell when it wasn't recorded very well).,
8946,1474,"Glorious sound, fantastic looks - soured by a few niggles","There's no point trying to be coy about it - these sound simply glorious and with their matched amps and corrected crossovers produce a level of detail, balance and togetherness usually reserved for a much higher price point. They do benefit massively from the addition of a sub that can be tucked away out of sight and with a bit of careful cable management and the right stands they are very graceful, minimal and non-intrusive. As someone who's lived with a profusion of cabling and extras for decades it's a big bonus, but just a cherry on top.

The problem is some software design choices - rather common sounding power on and off noises remind the user of turning on your PC or rebooting a phone or default ring-tones and you will  hear these very regularly as the speakers automatically power down and require manually turning back on even if a constant TOSLink or USB connection is maintained. The power cycling process produces loud clicks from the secondary speaker as the amplifier engages and disengages - considering no such noise comes from the primary this is a rather amateur moment. Finally to adjust any speaker settings you must stop whatever you're doing and switch input to bluetooth/wireless mode so the app is willing to access the speaker - this is clunky as hell and makes any finetuning a series of stabs in the dark.

Firmware can apparently be updated via a network connection but there is no information to be found anywhere within the app or KEF's product pages about where this firmware might be found, how to request updates or even how to receive notification of when updates might be available. Attempting chasing a remedy to this got me told there would be no updates unless enough people complained - hopefully the fact that half the reviews on this site comment on issues will get some action.

Generally a truly wonderful sounding product let down by a poor user experience which needs further refinement, hopefully forthcoming with a firmware and app update including a working FAQ section on such details. I would suggest discussion of firmware updates before purchase.",
8947,1163,Nice Speakers,I got these to enjoy my record player and digital music (I'm using a Sonos Connect Amp) and couldn't be more happy!,
8948,1343,"I AM VERY PLEASED WITH THE SOUND QUALITY, COMFORT AND REDUCTION OF EXTERNAL SOUNDS.",The headphones are comfortable to wear. They sound good. They do a good job of excluding sounds other than the sound source.,
8949,1488,Good sound over all.,Comfortable fit.,
8950,1163,Outstanding Audiophile Speakers,"About a month ago I first learned about KEF and had just purchased the LS50 Wireless; which are outstanding.  While I never planned to do this, I decided to set up a network steamer /CD Player in another room.  After days or reading reviews and checking out a small set of speakers, I started coming across reviews of the KEF Q100, as being a tremendous value; with outstanding sound quality across the spectrum, including the bass, in a bookshelf design.  So I decided to get the Q100s, and I'm not disappointed.  Particularly impressed with the bass from a bookshelf type speaker, the clarity of voices, soundstage, instrument separation and range across the entire spectrum.  The sound of a trumpet, and the unmistakeable beat of the kick drum.  Unless the Q100 won't fit your space, I am totally convinced that any KEF speaker is a no brainer winner!
",
8951,1163,Wow!,"I love these speakers. I'm coming from vintage Polk Monitor 10 floor standing speakers to these. Thought I would miss the large polks, but I was wrong! The detail and clarity these provide are amazing. I'm hearing things I've never heard in my music before. I'll be adding the 8"" Pioneer sw-8mk2 to add some presence to the bottom end. Most of my listening is done through Spotify premium and a chromecast audio. My vintage Marantz 2225 powers these speakers beautifully!",
8952,1161,Excellent Sound at a Great Price,"I bought a pair of these when KEF Direct had them at 36% percent off. One of the best purchase decisions I've ever made. My main use is for watching movies, but I also like to entertain company and use them to play music during parties. The sound quality is amazing when listening to music or anything that is stereo sourced. When watching movies the clarity of voices is wonderful. I would definitely buy these again if given the chance and highly recommend them to anyone looking for great sounding speakers that won't break the bank.",
8954,1163,Great Speaker at a reasonable price,"Got a pair of these for the reduced KEF price.  Auditioned against some Klipsch R-14's, a pair of NHT 1.3's and a smaller set of NHT sub zero's I have.  Clarity is very good. In my opinion  better by far over the Klipsh and the older set of NHT 1.3's.  The NHT's  did not deliver the light and detailed sound that the Q100's gave.",
8955,1162,Great set of bookshelf speakers with a surprising amount of bass.,"I've really enjoyed my new Q300 speakers.  They replaced a pair of B&W LM1's which were visually appealing and fit the space but lacked something when used as my mains in HT and music applications.  The Q300'S have an amazing sound and bring a good amount of bass into the mix.  They are a bit larger than the LM1's so I ended up getting some speaker stands which also helped with the resulting sound.  AND best of all, i got these on sale from KEF direct store.  I'd love to get the KEF center channel to go with them, saving my money......  ",
8959,1167,Q400b Subwoofer,"Great Product, love it.",
8961,1163,impressive speakers,"i'm using them as 2.0 system, the music presentation is spectacular, I had elac b5, wharfdale 225, and this tiny speakers destroy them from the bottom to the top.",
8962,1161,"Really great sound, better deal","I didnt have a chance to listen in person but I am thoroughly impressed and satisfied with the sound. I returned my monitor audio  speakers. The q500s were perfect and not too small for my living area which is  a medium sized room. I also found the monitor audios to be harsh on axis and  movie dialogue would hurt my ears sometimes. The KEF q500s have no such problems. Also no complaints about the build quality, everything arrived really fast ",
8963,1165,Clear and Detailed - Good Choice when matched with the Q100's,"Had an existing MartinLogan Motion 6 which fit in my Stereo Cabinet, but did not perform as well as I liked.  Auditoned the Klipsch 200c, the Definitive Technology C- 9040 and the  Paradigm Monitor Center 3 V.7 and finally settled on the KEF.  I think the KEF did the best job of isolating voices and making them clear.  The others all performed well but did not perform best to understand dialog at low volumes or whispers in certain scenes. I used the James Bond movie Specter as the medium.  As far as the speakers go,  Klipsch was the bottom, The definitive Technology was a far improvement and the Paradigm a slight improvement over the Definitive Technology.  Bear in mind I am focusing on Dialog and not the overall sound of each speaker.  The other speakers may have had an advantage with the larger drivers in providing a ""fuller sound"".  The Paradigm was quite good at reproducing sound albeit it was very large and looked very out of place compared to the other speakers.  The DT was nice as well but also I was not a fan of the open fabric panel on the top of unit.  I could see something being spilled or someone putting their hand through the fabric and damaging the passive speaker inside.  Both the DT and the Paradigm cost more that the sale price of the KEF and the KEF  works well with the Q100's purchased earlier.  At 399, no shipping cost or taxes, it became the clear winner.",
8964,1355,Doesn't get any better than this,Blown away.... Pull the trigger.,
8965,1162,Simply amazing,"Total blown away by the sound quality of these speakers.  Also, I called KEF twice and got great technical assistance.  And the design of these speakers is the best there is.   They looks so good.  But looks are nothing without the beautiful sound.  All the rave reviews that you read about these speakers are correct.

8966,1163,Engaging Speakers,"Wonderful!  Just replaced and older pair of Wharfdale  8.1s and a Cambridge Integrated Amplifier with The Q100 and a Rotel  RA-12.

Very crisp clear speakers  with a special sound quality that places them in a class of their own.",
8967,1163,"Amazing sound, particularly for the price","You get such amazing sound quality of out these attractive and well-built bookshelf speakers, that you'll be wondering why you had those big floor floor-standing pieces. Hearing some of my favorite tracks, with which I am very familiar, through the Q100s in a straight 2.0 (no woofer) setup with an inexpensive Onkyo receiver/amp, I hear sounds I didn't know were in the track. I just listened to Gershwin's ""Rhapsody in Blue"" for the 100th time, but the first from the Q100s, I heard parts of the track I didn't even know were in it. And keep in mind, it was recorded about 70 years ago AND I was listening to it over the radio. You'll be very happy with the Q100s. HIGHLY recommended.",
8969,1159,Get better and better,I love these speakers..they get better and better with more use. I am continually amazed at the beautiful range I hear from these...,
8970,1510,Good match not perfect,I would like to see him be at least 27 inches tall I also recommend two bags of sand for each speaker stand. Easy to assemble quality materials.,
8971,1510,"Great stand, but trash customer service","Try to purchase it from your local dealer if possible. If not, I recommend trying another brand unless KEF offers shipping options aside from UPS. 
My shipment got delays after delays. It might as well arrive next month. Then when it did arrive, it said available for pickup when it is actually not.
Don't waste your time on this trash service. ",N
8975,1163,Fantastic value,"Wonderful build quality from the Q100s make them very easy to present.  Point source design fills the room with very smooth,  easy sound with great imaging and surprisingly wide listening angles.   Notably more power hungry compared to my previous setup.",

8977,1165,Great clarity and works great with KEF bookshelf speakers,"This is the first center channel speaker that works for me.

Works great with the KEF Q100 bookshelf speakers",
8979,1188,Great Center Speaker,"I added this speaker to my home theater as my center speaker (mounted within my fireplace mantle) and the sound is crisp and clear.  Sound does not distort at high volumes. It looks great and it was a breeze to install.  High quality.

8982,1510,Great Compliment,Kef made these specifically for the LS50 and they compliment them just right. I believe I could find inert stands that are high quality for a less money but i have a sense of reassurance that I got the speaker and stand package that are good for one another.,
8983,1162,"Great speakers but I received the wrong color, LOL.","Got them on sale, great price, fast shipping, but I ordered white and received black.  I guess mistakes happen, no harm done, I'll keep the black.",
8984,1162,"Great Speakers, especially if you got them on sale.","Hello everyone,

Just got my new Q300's hooked up to my Parasound 2100 Preamp and 275 V2 amplifier.  All the reviews are accurate - great sounding speaker, especially for $399.  Buying speakers today is a bit more challenging than it used to be - back in the day there were brick and mortar stores where you could listen before you buy.  Unfortunately, those days and stores have gone (at least in my neck of the woods) so we have to rely on the internet and youtube to decide on the right speakers.  I was considering many options; the new Elac UB5, Dali Zensor 3's, JBL, ADAM, Emotiva, Wharefedale, among others.  I'm sure I'd have been satisfied with any of the above, but without being able to audition them, I had only other's opinions to to on.  So, when Kef announced that the Q300's were on sale, my decision was made.  

While shipping was very quick, I ordered the speakers in Linear White and received Black.  Not sure what happened there, but I see they are now out of stock on all colors so I suspect they ran out of White and just decided to send out the Black.  Ultimately, I'm happy; I guess mistakes happen.  

If your on the fence, just buy these.",
8985,1159,Great upgrade,Outstanding speakers that even impressed my wife non-audiophile spouse.  The clarity and breadth of the sonic output is mesmerizing.  She and I are both greatly enjoying what has proven to be an outstanding purchase.,
8987,1475,Simple and chic!,"  I was looking for something not too bulky and simple to wrap it. This leather cover is beautiful, it has the thickness of quality leather sofa.  It holds with two magnets.  So far no scratch on my Muo! Simple and chic!",
8988,1143,Absolutely love these speakers!,My best purchase. I bought these speakers for my office and it's a pleasure listening to music from these speakers. I love the soundstage presented by these speakers.,
8989,1143,Very high spousal acceptance factor,We have been running a gloss black pair for three years as front L & R.  We recently bought a gloss white pair to use as rear L & R.  The spouse found these to be so cute that we then bought a second white pair to replace the black!,
8994,1355,Sonically and visually beautiful,"Amazing sound from such small speakers, and the frosted black/blue color combination is gorgeous.

Instrumental detail and song lyrics are suddenly manifest, where they seemed muddy and smeared through my 10-year-old KEF Reference 203s.
Smooth midrange and excellent bass response for something that size.

These are an excellent value!",
8995,1355,These really are as good as people say - really.,"All I can say is wow.  I've always had a soft spot in my heart for KEF since I first heard the great KEF 104.2 towers at a high-end store.  I Finally bought some KEFs and I am glad I did.  These sound like the music just floats in the air between the speakers.  I've never heard anything with such an accurate soundstage.  I was listening to a track recently with an acoustic guitar intro with light keyboard and drum backtrack.  I could see in my mind where each instrument was in the studio.  The most amazing thing was when the vocal started.  It presented itself right above the guitar.  You could imagine the artist (Lyle Lovett in this case) sitting right in front of me playing.   You know a speaker is good when the experience is almost visual.

Get them, consider it a long-term investment.  You will want to hold on to these for years.",

I was listening to a track recently with an acoustic guitar intro with light keyboard and drum backtrack.  I could see in my mind where each instrument was in the studio.  The most amazing thing was when the vocal started.  It presented itself right above the guitar.  You could imagine the artist (Lyle Lovett in this case) sitting right in front of me playing.   You know a speaker is good when the experience is almost visual.

Get them, consider it a long-term investment.  You will want to hold on to these for years.",
8997,1162,"Meets all expectations, and the bar was set rather high!","Though I am still ""burning/running"" these Q300's in, I am thoroughly satisfied with the sound I am hearing in a small to medium sized living room.  I am not an audiophile, but I do appreciate a well designed speaker, and the Q300's are very impressive in build quality, and sound quality.  I listen to a wide range of music, classical, acoustic jazz, electric jazz, rock, on, and on, all through an integrated, stereo amplifier.  No AV receiver for these speakers, though that's just me.  I've read many reviews of the Q300's by folks using them with AV receivers who love them!
I will be listening to these speakers for many years, and am looking forward to adding more cd's to the library!
Kudos to KEF on such a fine product!",
8999,1510,White stands look great with white LS50,"I got the white stands to complement my white LS50 Wireless speakers.  It is hard to find high quality white stands so I appreciate the color matching KEF provides. They look great!  I ended up filling them with kitty litter as it was something I had lying around to house.  These stands are very sturdy.

One quibble I have is I was expecting some way of attaching the base of the speakers to the top of the stands with a physical bolted connection.

The stands arrived on time and in perfect condition.",
9000,1162,"Gorgeous, crisp sound!","These sound absolutely wonderful. Rich, full sound that manages crisp highs and thunderous lows at the same time.",
9001,1152,Great speakers.  Poor choice of finish!,"The speakers sound great, but very poor choice of finish (black,""white?"" or Walnut).
I also have a pair in rose wood that look much better than the choices available now.",
9003,1162,Q300 bookshelf speakers,I ordered the speakers recently when there was a snow storm going on in the northeast and I live in the southeast. To my surprise the speakers arrived extremely fast and everything was in perfect condition. I have the speakers on stands in my poolroom and they sound fantastic. They have great bass for such a small speakers and the highs are awesome. I would highly recommend these to anyone who wants a great pair of bookshelf speakers at a very good price. Buy them.... you'll love them!!,
9004,1514,floor protector Discs,"not worth the money they are small not easy to place under the speaker stands, don't seem to have any sonic benefits but protect  a wooden floor from scratches, cheaper and better options available on Ebay",
9005,1162,Very nice,"I also own a set of R700's... almost an order of magnitude more expensive than the Q300's.   The 300's do not sound as good, but for the money, they sound very impressive.   They have great bass response.  Highly recommended.",
9012,1474,Great All in One Speaker system,"I have owned these speakers for two weeks now.  The first weekend I ran them day and night in order to break them in.  They replaced the KEF X300A in my office system.  First of all they sound so much better than the X300A.  Much better bass and much better retrieval of low level detail.  Just much more musical.  One of the real strengths of this speaker is the connectivity.  It has both optical and USB inputs to get the most out of the internal DAC which by the ay can support 24/192 data rates.  The fit and finish are excellent.  I bought the gloss black and it just looks amazing with the blue speakers.  My only issue is not at all with the speaker but rather with KEF.  I can't tell you how many places I have read negative comments about these speakers because KEF insists on calling this a wireless speaker.  My right channel has five wires connected to it and my left channel has two.  While you can connect to this speaker via wifi or bluetooth it is far from ""wireless"".  That said I am siting here now listening to it via a microRendu and Roon and the sound quality is just amazing.  Highly recommended even if they are not really wireless.  ",
9014,1163,"Great sound, excellent price","Zero complaints about these speakers. Highs are sparkly and clear, mids are present and pronounced and there is just enough bass to satisfy most genres. The imaging is so accurate with these speakers, it feels like the sweet spot is anywhere in front of them. Spread them out, slight toe in, and be ready to rock out. ",
9016,1163,Excellent sound and quality... great price!,"I bought these at the sale price to replace some 15+ year old Canton LE120's which have served me very well.  I'm very satisfied!  Bass isn't quite as deep as the Cantons due, I'm sure, to the smaller drivers. However balance and clarity is noticeably better with the Kefs.  I'm not a rich man, and after researching for months, I truly believe you cannot do better for the price!  Running them thru a Marantz 1506 and an SVS SB12 sub....  sonic nirvana!!!",
9020,1162,Well executed small speakers,"I am using these as full range rear surround speakers powered by an Anthem MRX 720 A/V receiver. While I am still in the process of breaking in the speakers, I find that they handle the receiver's power well and provide dynamic sound across the frequency range. They are a bit large for surround speaker use in smaller rooms, but the size is compensated for by the improved sound quality, especially since they are outputting bass frequencies. They are particularly enjoyable when playing lossless 5.1 music DVDs like King Crimson's 40th Anniversary remasters. In this case, the sound quality is orders of magnitude better than most typical rear speakers. My other sets of KEF speakers are 15 and 37 years old respectively and still sound great, so I am a well satisfied customer.",
9021,1163,Best bookshelf speakers I've owned,"I was ready to buy the hot new kids on the block from that famous speaker designer until I saw the KEFs on sale. They match up nicely with my new Orbit turntable and old amp for really great sound. Even at full price, these little boxes are outstanding and there are some strong competitors out there. Still you won't go wrong with the Q100s",
9026,1161,product works as advertised,"I bought the speakers from the KEF direct website.  The speakers arrived in a timely fashion, were in great condition, and have so far worked as advertised.  I plan on purchasing the matching sub-woofer soon.",
9040,1165,Superb clarity,The Uni Q speaker and 3 way design makes a huge difference and provides superb dialogue clarity over 2 way center speakers.,
9041,1143,"Kef LS50 bookshelves, as good as a small speaker can get","first off I use these speakers in an unconvenient spot in my family room against a wall and above ear levels.  
They sound great there but not as good as they can.  I have a dedicated listening room where I have a much bigger
system and a proper amount of sound proofing and some acoustical performance room paneling.  I brought them 
into that room to burn them in and that's where I was blown away by these small speakers.  Probably the best sound staging
and balanced sound I've ever heard from a small package.  The mids and highs were nice, not too bright and the bass was 
pretty rich from such a small driver.  (i'm use to 4 10 inch woofers blasting at me).  If you can position them about three feet from each wall
and have them at ear level, toed in a bit, you will be blown away...if you have to compromise like I have you will still be happy.  Very
satisfied with my purchase!
",
9042,1143,High quality all around,"Very impressive speakers. I was on the fence about taking the plunge and spending CA $1500+ on these speakers. I had been using the Q100 bookshelf speakers prior to purchasing these - which were very good for the price point. It wasn't until I had demoed these at a local dealer when I really discovered the clarity and dynamic sound reproduction of the LS50's - Something you have to hear for yourself! Very impressive build quality, great design and quality finish. ",
9043,1143,Doesn't get any better than this,Blown away.... Pull the trigger.,
9044,1143,Sonically and visually beautiful,"Amazing sound from such small speakers, and the frosted black/blue color combination is gorgeous.

Instrumental detail and song lyrics are suddenly manifest, where they seemed muddy and smeared through my 10-year-old KEF Reference 203s.
Smooth midrange and excellent bass response for something that size.

These are an excellent value!",

9057,1151,Beautiful speaker that sounds as good as it looks.,"I've had iQ 7's and 5's in a home theater setup since 2009. I decided to create a surround system in my living room and settled on the R500's in white for the front L/R. While getting the living room room ready I hooked up the R500's and the R200c to my existing HT for some break-in. I didn't want to leave the room. No calibration, no room correction and still so impressive. It was more than I intended to spend but I couldn't be more pleased with the purchase. My only wish is that the feet were white like the cabinets. And that something much more suitable was included for hardwood floors. Thanks go out to Dave @KEF Direct for his help and guidance. ",
9068,1474,Excellent sound. Poor user interface and wireless features.,"I'll skip the sound part. In essence, this is a pair quality speaker from KEF.

Wireless features are half baked, worse if you are an iOS user. WIFI playback is limited to using LS50W's special APP. It plays music files that you ripped from your CDs but won't play with any streaming services such as Spotify, Tidal or Apple Music. You can also forget about Bluetooth aptX in iOS devices.

Since the Touch panel faces up, it's impossible to tell the power status nor input source from far. Nothing can wake up the speakers except the power button. You will be required to frequently walk over to the speakers to find out whether the speakers are ready. On off tune and the Bluetooth connection tune are similar and confusing. The same beep for every input sources is meaningless. You will check out the touch panel often.",
9071,1143,For the price these are simply outstanding.,"One thing that surprised so much about these speakers is the amount of room they cover. It's unbelievable how small these speakers are yet they easily fill a large room with great sound. The build quality is top of the line. The heft and feel they have when you touch them feels incredible. They're also very well aesthetically pleasing. And sound is simply amazing. I have my doubts about spending so much on speakers, specially for their size, but I am glad I still pulled through. ",
9139,1474,Good and beautiful speakers,"I like the speakers. I used KEF X300A powered speakers before. They were ok in sound quality nothing special. But LS50 wirelessly is noticeably better  in sound quality. I'm not go into details about it but  the best so far I've ever heard.
However,  I was disappointed in a few things . I can't use airplay with the speakers; I can't play apple lossless files with the app; and i asked inquiries about that and they said they would relay the questions to someone who has knowledge but no answer yet.
The experience could have been perfect. ",
9143,1143,A Classic,What can I say that hasn't already been said. These speakers are the benchmark. The speaker by which other speakers are measured. A current and future classic. Congratulations KEF for a job well done.,
9149,1511,Sturdy but....,"The build quality is impeccable and the stands do look good  wherever you want to put them and can be proudly displayed The only grouse i have is since I bought them for my LS50 speakers, there is no way to hold the speakers on the stand. They have to be perched on the stand without any means to lock them to the stand. Maybe they were designed with audiophile quality sound  - unfortunately if by chance you were to trip on the stand on the speakers you do run the risk of toppling them over. I came up using a two sided tape to hold the speakers to the stand but frankly that is a bit crude way to hold them.",
9154,1488,Just another great kef product,these headphones are execellent in sound very comfortable very well made product,
9155,1489,Just another great kef product,"The only fault I find with this product is the none wire for talking while you have them on ,I do not know what the designer was thinking of ,as for the rest I compared them with my noice cxl bose that I have that I use for business flights sound is better by far and the cxl side was as good ,of course this was tried in my house with loats of background noise but I feel that cable with the ability of talking is a must .But as for sound its going to be very hard to beat these at this price point.",
9157,1510,Pair well and well constructed,"Huge fan of these stands because not only do they pair well with my LS50 speakers and contribute nicely to rounding out the sound with some added inert filler, the paint application is super strong and seemingly impossible to scratch or chip based on my early observations. I replaced with highly recommended third party stands but would choose these first every time.",
9159,1474,High Quality Speakers - with some trade offs,"First off, these speakers live up to their reputation and reviews for sound quality.  For many listeners, a good quality subwoofer will be a must.  For me, the obvious absence of a strong bottom end to the sound just isn't as satisfying as what you get with a nicely matched subwoofer to handle what these speakers are incapable of delivering.  

Secondly, connectivity is very ambitious.  There are options for wireless, blue tooth, optical, aux, and PC.  For my setup, the optical solution works best - I drive all my sources via my Samsung TV (with Apple TV).  Hence, I get TV/Movie/and my Apple Music library all through one common/high quality connection.  Bluetooth works but sound quality not as good as optical.  Alas, wireless is very poor - and this includes intermittent and awkward controls for the DSP settings.  None of this is a show stopper - but be aware that some connectivity options work better than others.

One the whole - a solid value.  Very pleased with the investment.",
9160,1474,I thought I had quality before --- but that has changed now!,"Recently acquired these and to say impressed, astounded, amazed would just be an understatement. These speakers bring new clarity and quality to my music!  

A must buy; if you're thinking of spending some money; these without doubt have a small price tag for the quality!",
9162,1474,Excellent,I purchased these to replace the passive LS50 that I currently use... they exceed my expectation.,
9169,1169,Great looks and great sound,"I purchased a pair of T301 speakers to be placed on the wall on each side of our TV as part of a 7.1 surround sound system.  They not only look fantastic, but the sound clarity is excellent as well.  We used to struggle to hear the dialog but now it is crystal clear.   If you want a pair of beautiful, great sounding speakers - look no further!",
9172,1488,The best thing I've ever bought,Got these on Amazon and these are by far the best BT headset ever. Very comfortable and we'll built. Great sound and solid functionality. I can go for days without having to charge these and I use them for work and at the gym. Great job KEF!,
9174,1474,Great sound Gorgeous looking,"Having both X300W and the LS 50 in my Computer room powered  by Peachtree Nova 150 I always felt I was missing something So  this year I decided to order this from Amazon. and placed them in my computer room on 24"" stands connected the speakers and used after market shielded power cords ! WOW right out of the box they sounded fantastic ! my only concern is that with X300W I had to send them back to KEF when they developed a electronic fault of course the wonderful  tech people  at  Kef  replaced the parts for free and send them back to me in about three weeks . ",
9241,1488,Love this Headset!!!!,"I have the M500  over ear, the M200 and M100 in ears
I am only going to keep the M500 and Motion One.
The Motion One is much easier to drive than the M200 and M100. 
Although I like the range of the M200, they only sound better when Amped.
So the Motion one, wireless on the road or wired , they sound great!",

and clarity is superb!
Well done KEF,  I am totally happy!!!
Thank you

9264,1474,Sounds great but many issues,"These speakers sound great.  Nobody will dispute that.  But there are many usability and software issues.
For usability.  The remote is awful.  Cheap, plasticky, not responsive.  I replaced it with  a Logitech harmony 650.
No auto switching  of sources, no ability to control many functions and especially shut down time.
The software is terrible.  The app doesn't work right half the time.  There is a firmware update but it is PC only and many people are reporting issues after updating the firmware such as speaker stuttering and static.
Kef is clearly not prepared to support the software to the level these speakers requires.
Technical support e-mail goes unanswered and for some reason their support forum is on Facebook.  Not all of us have Facebook you know.  I value my privacy more than that.
I've had these speakers since December and am getting pretty fed up with the lack of support and terrible software.
Read some of the av forums listing all of these issues.  Lots of people are having them.
I'm wondering if Kef only allows positive reviews here.  Let's see if they post this.",N
9267,1229,great product,"I was using niles os-20 for years and I went with these ,these just sound wonderful outside ,just great.",

9270,1474,KEF direct excellent servic,"I purchased a pair of kef ls50 wireless speakers a few months ago and they are excellent.  Unfortunately my dog chewed up the remote. Couldn't find any information on how to purchase another one so I emailed kef direct. Three days later they had sent me a new remote no charge, not even shipping and handling. Fantastic company and will always recommend.",
9271,1162,Remarkable speakers,"Been listening to computer speakers so long I'd forgotten how much sound quality I'd been sacrificing.  I listen to very diverse music, usually randomly selected. The sound quality is so exceptional I'm constantly fooled by unexpected sound effects. Listening to the news it sounds as if the announcer is sitting right in front of you. Wonderfully transparent, remarkably clean. An excellent investment, especially on sale.",
9273,1162,Great Musicality,"I purchased new Q300s several months ago (just before the Q350s were released) to form the foundation of my new stereo system.  When I ran them in, I used a Denon AVR--1612 which advertised itself as a 75 wpc receiver.   I used the Denon in 2-channel mode with the ""direct"" button  engaged.  I was very pleased with the soundstage and clear instruments and voices.  The treble was a bit thin at higher volume levels with the Denon but it was going to be replaced.  
One moth ago, I purchased a new NuPrime IDA-8 integrated amplifier/DAC rated at 100 wpc.  The NuPrime is a fantastic match with my Q300s.  After running in the NuPrime, the Q300s sang.  Tight bass, wide soundstage, instruments and voices opened up with rich detail that was previously unnoticed with the Denon.  The NuPrime's  A+D hybrid power smoothed out the treble, resulting in a tube-like warm (but accurate) musical presentation.  The Q300's really benefit from quality power and the NuPrime has it.
Gino Vannelli's ""Brother to Brother"" had amazing vocal presence and the drums and guitar solo were great.  The same held true with the Yellowjackets' ""Can't we elope.""  The Q300s presented Cho Liang Lin's violin in Mendelssohn's ""Violin Concerto"" beautifully, with nice timbre and decay.  Toby Keith's vocals and the drums on ""Who's that Man"" were captivating; and you could hear licks and notes on Jimi Hendrix's ""Live at the Fillmore East, Machine Gun"" that were previously indistinguishable on my previous systems.   Great bass (no need for a subwoofer), fantastic soundstage and wonderfully clear and accurate instrument identification.  KEF hit a homerun with the Q300's.
Full volume with the source paused and you do not hear a sound, hum or anything else from the Q300s.  Cranking up the NuPrime to 99 (it's highest volume setting) and the Q300s were big room, party loud --  playing Justin Timberlake's ""Murder"" --  but maintained tight, controlled bass, clear instruments and vocals that were easily separated from each other, but musically joined in a rich, warm presentation.  The Q300s have a very British sound that I recall from my Wharfedale tower days.  I heartily recommend these speakers. (which, BTW, replaced the Wharfedales.

Not having heard them, I suspect the new Q350s are equally impressive.  I finished my system with a  Pro-ject Debut Carbon DC w/Ortofon 2M Red , Music Hall Mini Phono Stage, SVS Soundpath speaker cables and AudioQuest Evergreen (RCA) and Cinnamon (Coax) interconnects.  I haven't been this excited about stereo music since the '70's when I listened to vinyl with a Pioneer SX-626 and Avid 103 speakers.

9276,1410,Amazing Sound from Very Thin Speakers,"The Sound, the Details  !! Cant Believe that sound  coming out of these tiny speakers. 
Thank you Kef",
9277,1474,Great Setup,"Purchased a pair and they actually had a mould defect on the speaker and Kef replaced them no problem.  I have had a few App issues but sent feedback and I find Kef listen and are responsive. They sound great, look great and deliver on there promise.  Would definitely recommend.  I have replaced my Copland Cd player, musical fidelity amp, Dynaudio speakers and have no regrets.  Perfect for the minimalist lifestyle.",
9279,1510,Nice compliment to the speakers,"I was on the fence about purchasing these or building my own stands. Ended up going with these purely for convenience, they are a nice match and finish for the speakers in the end.
Bit pricey for what you get, should at least throw in floor discs, but guess $$ is usually not an issue for audio crowd.
Threw in a bag of sand while assembling and they sound and perform great.
Only real complaint is the engrish instructions. Not complex, you'll clue into  the fact one plate is countersunk for the tapered hardware pretty quick. They should instruct in how to install thread fittings in the tubes and the frankly the media filling instructions are still confusing me lol. In the end not rocket science just ended up figuring it out.",
9282,1474,Unbelievable!,"There is really no point going into the specific details on how these speakers sound.  If you are reading these reviews, you probably already have a good idea of what to expect.  

That said, the detail, spaciousness, and dynamics you get with these speakers are a steal for the price.  I had a violinist listen to these after I set them up and she could not believe that they were able to reproduce the vibrations and dynamics from the bow.  In her mind, it sounded the same as from a violinist's perspective when playing.  She couldn't even put everything she was feeling into words.  

In the end, just know that you will not find a better stereo setup for the price.  What KEF has done here is nothing short of remarkable.",
9284,1162,Great all-round performance from these stand-mount speakers,"Bought these Q300s in walnut finish  to replace a pair of 25 year old Mission speakers. Hooked up to my NAD C350 amp, and listen to mostly classical. Have not been disappointed - great stereo imaging, clarity and decent bass (given their size). Would definitely recommend, especially at the current bargain price!",
9285,1509,Another quality product from KEF!,"Made this purchase for my wife when her Bose Bluetooth speaker started not connecting to her phone.  She loves the color and really loves how clear her music is at low volume!
I got the ""package"" deal with the power charger and leather carrying case.  A great value in my opinion!
I have been a KEF fan since 1988 when I bought my KEF 104.2.  Those speakers are still going, though I have donated them to a worthy person.",
9288,1159,Unbeatable fidelity and musicality for the price.,Unbeatable fidelity and musicality for the price.,
9289,1474,Great Sound,"These speakers are smaller than I anticipated from their photos.  I bought them without first hearing them in the store and was very surprised by the very high quality of sound they produce given their dimensions.  Setup was easy.  Took them out of the box, connected the ethernet cable between the speakers, and then plugged them into the outlets.  Documentation is excellent, and a guided process helps through the software setup.  Sadly, the LS50W does require a wifi setup and the wifi app does not allow you to enter hidden network names.  So you have to unhide your network name in order for the app to find it, and then rehide it to protect wifi security.

The speakers sound a bit closed in the first day.  Not very dynamic.  But they open up after about 24 hours and continue to improve.  DSP setup greatly assists getting bass tuned for the closeness to walls and other room dynamics.  Trebble is extended.  Soundstage is wide and convincing.  Bass is far deeper than I ever imagined.  Imaging is excellent.  The LS50W plays loud without grain or distortion.  Superb sounding speakers at a reference level.

The outstanding sound is let down a bit by the simple remote, input selection process, wifi, and firmware updates:

- The remote has no visible means to identify the input selected.  

- You can choose between wifi connection, analog, Toslink, or USB, but you can only see the selection on top of the speaker.

- It is necessary to choose the wifi connection to change the speaker setup.  If you are listening through the USB input, you have to change to the wifi input.  Wifi takes a few seconds to reconnect.

- firmware updates are only possible via a windows 10 pc connected to the speakers via USB.  KEF should implement a network based firmware update process.

The Android App KEF uses to manage the speaker settings from a phone is not well designed and it is a pity there is only one app.  It would be great for KEF and the public if KEF would publish its LS50W API's and allow 3rd parties to develop better apps for the speakers.

For most people, these technical inconveniences are small in comparison to the convenience of a very small set of reference quality hifi speakers that simplify equipment purchasing and setup.  I'm sure KEF will improve interface and apps in the future and powered monitors will become more common and easier to use, changing the relationships of Amplifiers, Pre-Amplifiers, Speakers, Cables, and sources forever.

If sound is your primary objective, the KEF LS50W is about the easiest entry point into superb hifi.",
9290,1158,Outstanding,Very accurate sub...a must have!,
9291,1144,Why not use 5?,Thank you for making single speakers available so that I could set up a 5-channel home theater with LS50's all around. They sound as good as they look.,
9292,1474,LS50w lives up to all expectations,"I own the original LS50's powered by a hybrid tube integrated, so I had high expectations. KEF have the knowledge and equipment to pull off a proper execution of sound improvement over the passives. Out of the box, these are real performers! I now have a couple weeks break in time and things are beginning to sound more relaxed. These are so revealing that each album takes on its own character.
Give these a whirl and decide for yourself.",
9293,1162,HIGHYLY RECOMMENDED,"Added a pair of these Q300 to my home theater system as my front speakers, after buying a pair of their Q100 for my rear surround speakers. All I can say is WOW! What a deal at this sale price or even full price when they first came out. The detail, clarity and imaging is amazing. They have awesome midrange and even the bass is really good for 6 1/2"" driver. Pair these up with really good subwoofer, put on some good music that can really show off their potential and it will take plastic surgery to wipe the smile off your face. After getting these I immediately bought their Q200C center channel. I will be Huge KEF fan for long time, I just can't imagine any speakers out there that can out perform their Q series in that price range. Week after week they just get better and better as they get broken in.",
9294,1165,HIGHLY RECOMMENDED,"I purchased this center channel after getting a pair of their Q300 for my fronts and Q100 for my rear surrounds. Their perfect match in home theater system. Like their bookshelf speakers, it sounds awesome. The clarity, detail and imaging on their Q series are amazing. They also put out really nice bass for their size. The dialogue you get with this center is best I have ever heard, actually sounds like dialogue is coming out of the TV, not the front of the room. Some would say what is the difference, but there is big difference.  I also like the size, just small enough they fit my audio rack under my TV. I can angle them up to point right at my prime listening position. At this price, I haven't ever heard anything that sounds even close to as good as this center does. Trust me, if you haven't heard the KEF Q series, try them, I guarantee you will not be disappointed. ",
9295,1162,"Fantastic speakers. Well built, sound quality is awesome. ","I just want to start off by saying that I am pretty new to speakers. I have a 2.1 set up with these as my front speakers plus a sub. I use these in my living room (20' x 11') and they are about 8' away from where I am sitting. This pair is awesome and can get fantastically loud (I've actually never been able to play them anywhere near max volume with my receiver, and this is without by-amping them). Moreover, the quality of the sound itself is superb. I've noticed a huge difference in what sounds I can discern while listening to music (I mostly stream it from my computer or spotify). I would definitely use a subwoofer with these though. The bass is considerably better than the old pair of bookshelf speakers I had, but it's not enough to fill the room I'm in (for my taste). One final thought, these speakers are large.  Make sure you look at their dimensions and that they'll fit wherever you are planning on putting them. I have dedicated speaker stands that they are sitting on, but if you don't have a ton of room on a shelf or stand you may run into problems.  ",
9297,1170,Center speaker is amazing,The sound quality is top notch. Can't believe it took me so long to jump from B&w to KEF.,

9299,1173,T-2 slimline sub,Excellent sound and great looking.  This is my second T-2 sub.  Was so amazed with the first i replaced the sub in our Master bedroom.  Amazing and well worth the money.,
9300,1143,Amazing sound and look!,My foray back into vinyl and a better approach to analog began with the LS50.  Clearly the best way to start the build of a system...they are fantastic!  Thanks KEF!,

9303,1159,awesome speakers,I got the q900 series when it was offered with special price and these speakers are amazing and perfect for my home theater. I am using these with.my other Egg shaped KEF speakers and I feel like I am in an actual movie theater. Highly recommend if you need the base and power.,
9305,1342,"A solid choice for good quality sound at moderate price...that is the $99, not the $149 price","I would recommend these at the $99 price point.  Sound is very good as is quality of the ear buds themselves.  Two issues, one potential the other actual.  Potential issue: the wires to the ear buds are very thin and one hopes not as delicate as they look.  If they do not break within the next year I will come back and revise this review to that effect.  Actual issue: this is the first set of ear buds I have owned where the fit just does not seem right.  All other ear buds I have owned I have needed to use the medium or large rubber ear tips.  With these, I use the small ones and even still they are not secure.  Every few minutes, if I move at all (walk, work out at gym, etc.) I need to push them back into place and adjust their angle to where the fit is snug.",

9307,1143,iNCREDIBLE SPEAKER PERFORMANCE AND BUILD QUALITY FOR THE MONEY,"Having been a long time KEF fan with a pair of 104.2 for over 20 years, it was easy to return to KEF as my first choice for a second pair of speakers.
Going to audio shows, I always seek out  the KEF Ls50's on display to see which electronics they are hooked up to.
Some sound better than others but I have never been disappointed with hearing the Ls50's.
Reading my audio magazines it seems that every reviewer has a pair in their personal collection of gear.
Equally impressive is the amount of reference these little speakers get.
Also right out of the box received my wife's approval.
If and when I have to go down to one set of speakers these are the ones I could not live without.
Deep wide sound stage crisp without crackle these are reference monitors.",
9308,1159,"Great sounding, well balanced speakers","I purchased the Q900's to replace a pair of IQ7's as the front speakers in my home theater system. The speakers are a tad bit larger  but by no means ugly. With a well powered receiver, Denon AVR-4800, the range and clarity of the speakers shine.  They are outstanding front speakers for  home theater and equally impressive  for music. Would definitely recommend.",
9309,1159,Incredible fidelity!,"These are my second pair of KEFs.  I recently replaced a pair of 103/4's I bought about 25 years ago with the Q900's.  I am BLOWN AWAY by the sound quality!  When I listen to my old favorite albums or CDs that sounded very good on my old KEFs, I have shivers going down my spine as I hear things that weren't there before.  A truly awesome speaker!",
9310,1162,Awesome,Those are nice speakers. Looks nice in white color.,
9312,1162,strongly recommend,"I am very happy with the purchase and enjoying lively music since I bought it.  The sound is very clear and detailed. I tried 3 other speakers (Monitor Audio, Whaferdale, and Dali) and I think it is the best speaker below $500 at the moment.  I strongly recommend it. ",
9316,1509,Surpassed expectations!!!,"As a music lover, I research audio products thoroughly prior to purchase. The KEF Muo had overwhelmingly positive reviews for build, battery, and sonics. The build is solid and the design paying homage to the Muon is aesthetically appealing. The included soft leather cover feels wonderful, and snuggly protects the speaker. The addition of the portable charger alleviates any concerns of battery life, even on long trips. The acoustics are fantastic and allow the sonics openness and honesty true to the original recordings. Unlike most portable speakers, the bass lends it's power to bring this little speaker fully to life. BRAVO to KEF and your brilliant engineers. Keep up the good work!",
10424,1532,These speakers will give you an enjoyable  time of listening.,"It replaced the old Q70 ( Made in  England)  that I enjoyed for many years.  Q950  has a more solid and deeper bass. The midrange sounds so natural.  All the improvements that was claimed by this speakers are true to the sound that it  produce.  You'll be immerse in the emotion of the music  that  you love to  listen.  Don't take my words for it, give it a try yourself. Happy listening",
10426,1153,Sound and look great,"These speakers both look and sound great with an amazing stage and a warm and precise sound. I was also specifically looking for white speakers, and these look just beautiful. Last, shipping and delivery was fast and the speakers came well wrapped up in a sturdy box. Highly recommend!",
10427,1162,Q300's Excellent Choice!,"I'm impressed the Q300's for both direct stereo 2 channel mode and as fronts in a 5.1 system. Playing in direct stereo mode they provide enough full bass on their own that no sub is needed for my room. In surround mode the imaging is very good and without using a center channel the Q300's place the vocals right on the center of my screen.  I'm happy, these are keepers!",
10428,1162,Great set of speakers!,"Nice quality set of speakers, and a steal with the current sale price on them. Really like the look of the white speakers, and they look even better without the front grills! Does a nice job filling our room with sound, and has a good range. Really brings out the quality of sound of our vinyl collection.",

Started buying the rest of the upgrade right away. Just wish KEF had a returning customer discount like SVS does!",
10437,1163,KEF Q100,I bought a pair of Q300s in January.  These speakers absolutely rock audio spectrum are worth paying list price.  Frank Zappa never sounded better thanks KEF for my system is complete with my 4 pair of bookshelf speakers.   Chico,
10438,1155,absolutely phenomenal,"I did a lot of research before buying this. Matched with R300 left and right. The R600 is phenomenal. It takes up some space, but I have room under the TV and it looks good (or, rather, doesn't look imposing at all; the black grill helps it hide in the shadows). When I first listened, I start laughing - I had a hard time believing that a speaker could sound so good. Thanks, KEF!",
10439,1565,Space Wonderful,"I'll start by saying I'm not an audiophile, but I've owned/tried many mid range over ear headphones. I upgraded to the space one from the Audio-Technical ATH M50 and Pro700 MK2. 

I wasn't necessarily looking for bluetooth, but I wasn't going to say no. Here's my take on the Space one

SOUND: 7/10 (Bluetooth) 8.5/10 (Wired)
These headphones sound great both wired and wireless, my complaint with the bluetooth is that it wasn't anywhere as loud as it needed to be on my mobile device. This could be hardware limitations but I have a pretty recent smartphone and I still found myself having to go over 75% to get decent volume. My laptop was much better, 50% was all I needed. 

That being said, the wired quality is where these headphones really shine. More experienced listeners than me will probably have a more nuanced take, but these headphones do all genres of music justice. The vocals and stringed instruments stand out, as doess the low end bass on hip hop and electronic songs. I haven't found a genre that these are lacking in yet. I also find that they have a very wide sound stage, I compared them to the Bose QC and Sony MDRX 1000 (Not the newer WH model) and found those models had muddy bass and the mids and vocals did not shine as much. 

ANC: 6.5/10
It's nowhere near as good as what Bose and Sony have to offer unfortunately. That being said it works very well on my commute on the subway and it's amazing to block out some of the white noise at home and listen at much lower volumes. The 6.5 seems low, but I would rank the Bose and Sony at 8 and 7.5 respectively. The ANC on these definitely works, but it's far from best in class. I believe the tradeoff in improved sound quality over the Bose and Sony  headsets is worth a small loss in ANC efficacy. 

USABILITY 9/10
This is the most important part of the headphone experience after sound quality. Who cares if it sounds good if I can't wear it for 4+ hours without strain. I'm happy to report these headphones are extremely comfortable to wear for extended periods of time.

There is no pinch on the headband or excessive pressure on the ear cups. You may have to play with the fit to get full ear coverage given the more oval shape of the cups, but it's no major issue.

The buttons are well thought out and intuitive to use, play/fastforward/rewind functions work smoothly and make clicking through a playlist effortless. The pause button also supports voice entry for Siri etc. 

Battery life is absolutely amazing, I'm able to get through 3-4 days of consistent use (both ANC and bluetooth on)  before the battery gets to low. The bluetooth connection is lightning fast, I wish Android would include bluetooth battery information like my iPhone does.  

BUILD QUALITY
These are gorgeous, the aluminum is a great touch and feels very sophisticated. At this price point I wish genuine leather was present, but the memory foam pleather is very comfortable and not sweaty. The cups rotate inward so you can put them in the case,  but they do not fold like Beats or some other brands. 

The packaging honestly blew me a way, the case is gorgeous and you receive two aux cables, an airline adapter, a USB to charge the cable (type A). The hard case that comes with the headphones is also pretty quality. 

WHAT WOULD I CHANGE:
I think the ear cups could be larger, granted I have huge ears but still. I would also like to see an improved mic with some noise cancellation (this may be a necessary cost savings for the amazing sound quality). 

I think the ANC can be improved, and the headphones could be made more foldable. 

I wouldn't mind a blacked out version, and a longer USB cable but at this point I'm just nitpicking. 

CONCLUSION:
My first purchase from KEF, the customer support was very helpful in answering some questions I had before my purchase. I called the toll free number and actually got a human being! Shipping was lightning fast and free, the product is quality. What more can you ask for? I look forward to buying more items from KEF in the future. ",
10440,1198,Great Shallow Speaker,Great speaker for shallow installs.  Sound is clear and crisp.  Great documentation.  Nice job.,
10441,1169,Great speakers!,I just got the T301 and T301c for my home theater and let me tell you... They sound great!!! Highly recommended.,
10442,1474,Stunning,"Beautiful reproduction of digital music.  Warm, clearly defined, with gorgeous soundstage, this is an all-in-one system that takes the guess or ""synergy"" work out of having to match DACS with amps with speakers. 
To match this quality of sound, one would have to spend a great deal more money. 
If you love audiophile sound quality and have hi res files, this will fit the bill.  
As others have said, the app is not great, but I imagine it will be improved.  It is, for us, a non issue due to the comparison to sound quality. 
We use Chord Mojo and Hugo 2, with Beyerdynamic T1 and T8 headphones, so this is our reference point of comparison.  It is difficult to get the beauty of Chord/Beyer combination in open air music. 
The KEF LS50 with an expensive DAC/amp added will do it, but now the LS50 wireless does it without the expensive components. 
Classical music to Dylan to Springsteen to...well, it does it all.  We don't know if adding a subwoofer is even needed!  
",
10443,1143,SUBLIME!,"So my summary statement I feel says it all ""Sublime"" which means ""excellence, grandeur, or beauty as to inspire great admiration or awe"". That is how I would describe these speakers. They are beautiful to look at, no doubt. Their excellence and grandeur is second to none in my opinion. I was definitely in awe when I first listened to them, I've only had them for two days I can't wait to hear what they sound like once they are broken in. I never heard speakers before that had this kind of clarity, detail and high's like I never heard before. They put smile on my face that will take plastic surgery to remove. I thought their Q300 were awesome and for the money they surely are, but these are in another class of their own, now I see why they list them in the flagship category. Now I want to upgrade my center (Q200C) which will be with a single LS50 for a perfect matched left, right and center.",
10444,1179,Large frequency imbalance on my desk,Measured 17 dB peak at about 160 Hz on my desk. Not recommended for desktop use or near rear-wall placement. I returned them. Really nice center image.,

10448,1474,Impressive and Versatile,"Sound is pretty astonishing coming out of these small, seemingly simple speakers.  Of course, they're actually not simple at all under the hood, and they offer a plethora of connectivity options and modern streaming support.

Between WAF-approved looks, great sound, and versatility, KEFs LS50W's really set the bar for ""what's to come"".

The software and interfaces can use a good deal of work however....",
10449,1155,Excellent speakers.  Love the build and sound quality.  Didn't know what I was missing from my concert blu-ray disc.," I love KEF R series and I already owned a pair of R300 and a pair of R100, and getting the 600c completed my upgrade to  KEF.  Even though I already owned the bookshelf speakers, this still surprised me on the additional clarity I got, especially for vocal / concert, but for movie dialogue too.",
10450,1167,Kef Q400b subwoofer,I was lucky enough to win mine at the Rockville Audio Show this year. Very happy with the look and sound of the unit. Plus it did not hurt that I won it.,
10451,1574,Fantastic,"I added this subwoofer to the KEF LS50 W  series.  Although the LS50W doesn't need a subwoofer, adding it has made a great sound even more enhanced.  The sound is rich, deep, but it is very clean.  It balances very nicely and is controlled by the KEF app.  It is the type of sound that once you experience it, you cannot go back and listen to music without it.  Well made,  it lives up to the KEF reputation. ",
10452,1229,KEF incomparable quality,"KEF quality sound.  Your ears will never tire of the high quality sound  with eye pleasing   design. 
The highs,  mid range and lows  will keep you  out  on the patio even in bad weather, unless you have KEF  speakers indoors.   I’m getting rid of the Sonos & Bose  so I can have quality KEF sound indoors too.   Excellent speakers at an affordable price.   ",
10453,1144,Awesome Center Channel!,"After recently purchasing a pair of LS50 speakers for my front home theater speakers, I was so impressed that I wanted to upgrade my center channel as well. After looking at the R200C and the LS50 I decided to go with the LS50 since it would give me a perfectly matched set for my front speakers. Sounds beautiful and gives a seamless soundstage up front. Now I know why they say it's very important to have matching speakers when setting up a home theater system. Big improvement over the Q200C I was using.",
10454,1159,One Word - Ommale,Extremely build quality and fantastic Speakers. Way to go KEF!. World Best Speakers .,
10455,1163,Excellent sound for a 3.1 system,"I have had these speakers now for about 3 years now.  I'm sure they are completely broke in by now but I remember them sounded as good when new out of the box.  When I was shopping for speakers I wanted something that would suite our needs in a family room without doing a whole 5.1 or 7.1 system.  I'm so content with my setup I have yet to add more speakers.  This sounds strange coming from a person that has always had  fancier surround sound systems, even inwall and ceiling speakers.  My room is 20x15 with 9ft ceilings and its sounds fabulous.  My center channel is a KEF T301c and my subwoofer is a Paradigm 10"" powered sub.  Thanks KEF for the great experience.",
10456,1163,Great Bookshelf Speakers!,"I am extremely pleased with the quality of the build and the sound of these speakers.  I am using them in a true bookshelf application on my built-in cabinets so having a front port is crucial .  The highs are really great even at near field, ear level, high volume.

I am not a big believer in ""break-in"" periods with the exception of the effect that stretching out the voicecoils and surrounds has on cones ability to reproduce bass and that is what I believe I have found here.  The bass has improved a small amount with exercising the units at higher volume levels.  Nothing earth shattering but a nice small improvement nonetheless.

Used for Tidal, and vinyl through a Denon PMA-50 integrated amp.  Just enough power in that little amp to push these well until my Sprout II arrives in the spring.  ",
10457,1163,Happy with overall purchase,Xcellent,
10458,1163,WOW !   6 Stars.  Where have these been all my life !,"Somehow I got an add wanting me to check out the KEF sale, boy was I glad I did.  I listen to music most of my free time; the TV is for news and the occasional show, and these fit my needs VERY well.  

I use AIRPLAY to 4 stereos in 4 rooms, and I can’t have big floor standing units in my garage, office and bedroom.  I wanted to hear how these sound, so I figured since I’ve spent more on other brands, what the heck. I was so surprised how good these little ones sound; I bought a 2nd pair 2 days later.  I use 4 Klispch’s & 2 Bose 701v in my living/TV room, and these rival them, just lacking the built-in subwoofer bass.

I was also pleased KEF allowed me to have my package delivered to the UPS customer center, instead of my home.  Not being home until late in the day, and package theft out of control, I was able to get them securely at my convenience, so neither KEF nor myself was affected negatively.  

Thank You.

10459,1139,A top candidate for the best loudspeaker ever made,"Ultimate loudspeakers are like supercars.  Surrounded by hype, often times with massively inflated price tags, and a cult-like but always small following, given their punitive prices.  In the rarefied air of candidates for best loudspeaker – and there are no doubt dozens of those, including some rather exotic off-brands where their principal basis for a claim to greatness is a mid five-figure to mid six-figure price tag, the KEF Blades are a veritable bargain at $32k.  

Ever since I was a kid I've loved music, and since my late teen years, have craved loudspeakers that may at least make some legitimate claim towards being the best available transducer.  And make no mistake about it, it's the signal chain transducers that make the biggest contribution the sound quality, including of course the quality of the microphones used by the studio, and the skill of the sound technicians in setting them up – a key variable over which even the most obsessive audiophile has no control.  It's been long appreciated that phono cartridges and loudspeakers – as signal transducers changing a signal from electrical to acoustic/physical or from physical to electrical – make the most significant contribution to your sound system and the perceived qualities of its acoustics.  In my teens I lusted after the Walsh A – a unique speaker that required 250W to play at a reasonable level and 260W to blow its voice coil.  Fast forward to 50 years later and now semi-retired, I decided that after the briefest of auditions, the KEF Blades were on my bucket list, while the Ferrari, and a number of other pieces of wishful thinking were simply not happening.

A pair of these became available on Audiogon for a very reasonable money from a very responsible seller.  They were local pickup only, and in some God-given bit of good luck, the seller was within an hour.  They were not an easy speaker to move, as the boxes are almost 6 feet tall, and weigh about 150 pounds each loaded.  But with my wife's considerable help I was able to move these massive columns into the house and set them up without a scratch  . . .  Except to the wood floors.  Oh well. 

They are simply the best speaker I've ever heard – creating a seamless and broad sound field, smoothly integrated, and with no emphasis to any part of the spectral balance or recorded acoustic.  Highs are extended but not hyped, lows are all there, but again not any version of boomy, not hyped or exaggerated and the mid range is also spot on.  You will invariably notice new musical nuances in your favorite musical conpositions that you've never heard before.  The Blades are simply clean and neutral in a way you have to hear to appreciate, with superb transient response.  Take a close look at the Stereophile review of their little brother, the Blade IIs – and JA’s measurements section (the best technical reviewer in the industry) shows about as flat a frequency response curve as you’ll find anywhere.  Coming from a set of Reference 107s, the bass may not hit you in the face (or abdomen!) as much, but it extends just as deeply, down to 20-25 Hz without any trouble.  And because of placement of the force-canceling pairs of 9 inch woofers well off the floor, there is not as much boundary reinforcement as many large speakers, although of course in anything except an absolutely huge listening hall, you're going to get some of that.  The bass is just  . . . well for lack of a better term . . . fully believable, authentic, and such that listening to other large speakers that you once thought had great bass leaves you subtlety dissatisfied once you’ve experienced the Blades.

If you can afford them, they are easily finalists for the best loudspeaker ever made, with KEF engineering frankly being more advanced than just about anyone’s, and resulting in a single apparent point source for sound, centered on the integrated tweeter-midrange driver.  And if something costing this much can be considered a great value, they are shockingly less than some other ‘ultimate louspeakers’ while putting most of them to shame.  Compared to the well reviewed other elite speakers over five figures, such as the big B&W 802s, the Revel Salon IIs, the Magico S5, the Vandersteen Model Seven Mk.II, or any of the Wilson Audio speakers, a few of these are less than the Blades, but many are more, and none have quite the seamless quality of the Blades.  Audition one with some of your favorite material, but be prepared to be dissatisfied with what you are listening to currently.

10460,1514,Absurd,"Charging $30.00 for these to go with a $250 pair of stands is criminal. Should come with speaker stands.  Rating of sound quality mandatory for submission of review, also silly.",N
10461,1175,"Wow,  sounds great and looks great ","In the middle of doing a home remodel we had the great idea of doing a home theatre setup in the living room.  My priority is sound quality and my wife’s is aesthetics.  Well, KEF doesn’t disappoint on either front.   These speakers sound good and look good.  I’m more than pleased with them.  My prior speakers were some KG4’s and these are just as good.    No hesitation on recommending them sound wise.   But more than sound and looks, the packaging was great with very good mounting templates, good hardware and instructions.

10462,1343,Wonderful sound quality!,"These are the first headphones I've ever heard that satisfied me.  They actually sound like KEF loudspeakers in miniature on all of my favorite music, with the exception of the bass emphasis.  The bass does not interfere with the clarity and beauty of the sound, however, and doesn't seem bloated to me.  My only complaint is the fit, which is a bit odd if you have to extend the earpieces out.  Other than that, these are really wonderful headphones on everything from symphonies, opera, chamber music, jazz, and Mariah Carey (the only pop music I like haha!).",
10463,1175,Surprising,"I purchased these somewhat on blind faith, without actually listening to them.   Generally, that would never happen in a million years, but this was going to be a highly visible addition to a bedroom flanked in vibrant grey and white.  The choice of speakers was more to appease, than anything else.   That being said, the sound quality is surprising.   Astonishing levels from something that is so very thin.  It's thicker than the OLED it is flanking, but it's close enough not to distract from the room in the slightest.  The mounting system is fantastic, and I'll likely move the LCR over to a wall mounted solution, but as it stands now, everything looks amazing on the supplied brackets.

To me, it is significantly larger sounding than the space consumed.  It's also an EXCELLENT solution where aesthetic _has_ to be a concern.  The build, design, and sound quality from this set shows considerable time and engineering resources spent wisely.  

Highly Recommended. ",

10465,1199,Great Headphones,"These are a nice comfortable pair of headphones with great sound.  The sound stage is nice & I can clearly hear subtle sounds within the music that I am listening to.

The only minor quibble that I have is that the ear pieces seem to rotate in the wrong direction. ",
10466,1163,Excellent entry-level option,"I bought several Q100 pairs in recent months. The first pair replaced Infinity Reference 152s in my desktop system. The imaging, transparency, and tonal balance impressed me enough to audition the Q100s as the mains (on 26"" stands) in my 7.1.4 system (replacing Infinity Primus P163 towers). Definitely a step up. So I replaced all P163 and P152 speakers in that system with Q100s.  For movies, I don't notice much difference. For music listening in stereo, the larger P163s may have the edge. However, for stereo music sources upmixed to Atmos or DTS:X, the Q100s far outperform the Infinity Primus gear (as they should).  Also, stereo music sources upmixed via DTS:X never sounded right to me through the Primus speakers (I would always use Atmos for upmixing), but through the Q100s, DTS:X is an entirely different listening experience for me; now I always choose DTS:X and never upmix stero music sources via Atmos.  I also mounted a pair of Q100s in the corners (at the ceiling) of my kitchen; the bass response from the Q100s was a little too 'robust' in that location, but inserting the included foam dampers in the ports took care of that. I expect to enjoy the Q100s for years to come. ",
10467,1161,Great speakers,"These have a clean balanced sound. They fill up my apartment living room with sound very nicely and have the great KEF imaging and clarity you would expect. These can go well without a sub, but with one the system totally rocks.",
10468,1163,Perfect for my desk..,"Bought these after much research. They are perfect for my small computer room. Combined with a Cambridge audio stereo amp, an SVS sub, and  my PC  it gives me  great sound. These speakers  have  excellent highs (clean and not harsh) and just the right bass for my ears.  Very glad I made this purchase!",
10469,1162,"Excellent sound, good value, great build quality","I purchased these to use in a stereo setup to replace my old Paradigm Mini-Monitors that I have hooked up to a NAD D3020 for my office. Compared to the Paradigm's, the Kef speakers are much clearer in the mid-range, extend better at the low end (although some may want a Sub for really deep  Bass) and have a better soundstage.

My hearing  at  my present age is still brilliant and I enjoy the full richness of  sound. If you want  real punchy  bass , perhaps not the right set for  you- perhaps chk out M500.

Set it up on my living room and they look incredible on the wall and sound better then they look! The sound is very natural and extremely crisp and clear. The quality and sound balance from such thin speakers are a wowy factor. Subwoofer is amazing its vibrating pleasingly.  Highly recommended,

10482,1143,Excellent speakers at a remarkable price,"I took advantage of the $999.99 sale price and am very glad I did. This is my third pair of KEF loudspeakers (a vintage pair of 303.3's, a pair of Q100's and now the LS50's). Each was large step up in quality from the previous. The cabinet of the LS50 is surprisingly small, but very solidly constructed. It is the most acoustically-inert cabinet I've encountered. I can't comment on the difference(s) between the Uni-Q drivers between the Q100's and the LS50s. The curved front baffle is supposed to minimize diffraction and that does seem to make a big difference in the imaging.  

I happen to run mine with a (miniDSP-controlled) subwoofer. So I have no complaints about the bass extension.",
10483,1474,Superb Sound in a small package!,"I cannot believe the full, clear sound these produce!  I have my Marantz CD player hooked up to the analog inputs on the KEF right speaker, and also listen to Tidal through the wifi application.  My speakers are set up on heavy sound anchor 24"" stands that improve the sound over flimsier stands.  The wireless app could be improved (it sometimes does not allow seamless playback on Tidal) and it would be nice to see the display (which is on top of the right speaker) while sitting down, but the incredible sound more than makes up for these shortcomings.  Usually small speakers sound anemic and not ""fleshed out"".  These have the ability to produce tones accurately, with good dynamics and clarity, and bass response into the 40hz range.  A winner!",
10484,1474,Terrific speaker with more with versatility than anything I have ever experienced in this domain,"I struggled a bit choosing these speakers because I have the wireless Dynaudio Tower speakers in my living room and they are terrific. I thought of networking them with Dynaudio bookshelf model in my upstairs office since I was very satisfied with their performance. However the KEF LS50W adds so much more value in that the connectivity, the onboard USB DAC, bluetooth and its subwoofer out made the decision easier to choose the KEF. Musically I think they are better by a bit in that they seem to have better higher end detail, a bit more spaciousness in the sound stage and are more forgiving of source material than the Dynaudio.

I highly recommend this speaker system as both a great value and a great performer!",
10485,1163,WOW ! 6 Stars. Where have these been all my life ! Review by Range,"After getting an ad for KEF, I thought I’d try a pair to see. So last month I bought (2) Q100 to try, I was so pleased I bought another (2) for my home office the next week.  Now I see the big Christmas sale and couldn’t resist, so I bought another (4) Q100’s for my TV room, replacing Klispch RB61ii. Now that I have (8) Q100’s, I might have to replace my Bose 701v’s with some KEF floor standing speakers; which ones?  

Thank you !

10486,1163,Q100,Simply the best bookshelf speaker in its price range!!,
10487,1264,Great sound,So far so good with this system! We moved into a new house and in wall speakers were not possible. My wife hated the bulky wall speakers that came with the house so off I went searching for a compromise. Stumbled upon these and we could not be happier. They look great mounted on the wall  (nice and slim) and the sound is amazing for how small they are. I would definitely recommend this setup.,
10488,1175,Great product - one minor issue.,"Great product - impeccable sound and sleek, great looking form factor. Sound is what you expect fro mKEF which is impressive given the slim profile of these speakers. My impression is only dampened a bit by the fact that my T2 sub did not ship with a power cord.  ",
10489,1163,"Overall, I'm very pleased with the sound and I may explore purchasing another model of bookshelf speakers from KEF."," Years ago, I almost bought a pair of KEF 104.2 speakers but for whatever reason that I can't recall now, I did not.  Fast forward 30 years, I just bought a pair of Q100 speakers and am I glad that I did because the mid bass and the the high sounds wonderful, albeit lacking in deep bass but that's okay because I have many choices of subwoofer to blend with it.  Now, about that 10W min. to drive the speakers, I would say it should have been at least 20W because based on my experience after listening to it for a week now, the sound quality from 10W per channel is just inadequate.  Overall, I'm very pleased with the sound and I may explore purchasing another model of bookshelf speakers from KEF.",
10490,1343,Kef the only way to go....,"I love Bose, JBL and Boston Acoustics but Kef would be the speaker/headphones i would choose because of the quality sound it provide when i enjoy my music. ",
10491,1200,Good sound (I think!) but HORRENDOUS fit = frustrating experience.,"I wrestled and wrestled with the strange, strange ear hooks, but no contorting them could get them to stay in my ears.   Using the large tips helped about 10% over the medium, but that's it.  When I hold them in manually, and get a good seal, I can hear what I think is really excellent audio reproduction, but they just will NOT stay out.  After listening to several songs with them, and them continuing to slide out slowly until they turn the sound into a sad, sad tinny, joke, I literally ripped the out of my ears and threw on on my desk in disgust.  If they could fix the horrible fit on these, these hold a lot of potential.

Incidentally, I also have the KEF M100, which are rather good sounding (can't tell if as good as the M200 as I admit my experience with the M200 is soured rather dramatically by the horrendous fit), and without the terrible fit problems of the M200.  Can't recommend these even at the great price of $59.99 that I got them direct from KEF.",N
10492,1143,Great when used with a sub-woofer crossed over at about 65Hz,"This is my second set. Gave the others to my wife and later found I missed them on my system. Replaces a set of R100 monitors with sub-woofer. These are so refined and a great match with nearly any good quality amp with sufficient power. The amps I have used are rated between 250W and 300W into 8 ohms. Obviously most average program material requires less than 30W except on peaks. It's nice to have an amp with a 1KW+ transformer and supply to ensure constant DC rails. I actually prefer the sound of these LS50's to the LS50W's I have in the master bedroom. It's also nice to be able to tune the system with amps, pre's and DAC's. Where the LS50W's excel is in the integration and ""system in a box"" (or two). I would not give up either setup.
The wife's integrated system is 150W into 8 ohms and to me doesn't quite deliver the goods when pushing it a bit. There are many forums and reviews which can guide a user to good amp/speaker combo's for those interested.",
10493,1165,Met and perhaps exceeded expectations,"I did quite a bit of research on center-channel speakers around the $500 US price point.   That research included reading reviews as well as evaluating specs, build quality and everything else.   The KEF Q200c was at the top of my list.    I wanted a center-channel speaker that would be very good for both home theater and music listening.    My expectations were high.   After purchasing it (in rosewood veneer) and using it in our living room system for a week, it has met and perhaps exceeded those expectations.   This is a very neutral-sounding center-channel speaker with excellent dispersion and taut bass within its specs.     It is very good with both 5.1 center-channel content, and with music (e.g. CD content).    I expect that after further break-in, the bass will improve a bit more too.   For a 3-way center-channel speaker in this price range, it sounds and looks great!",

10526,1153,The R100s are perhaps the best small speaker value extant . . . and that includes the highly regarded LS50s.,"It's safe to say that these speakers are almost ‘impossibly good’.  By that I mean when compared with much more expensive Reference speakers in Premier KEF line, or even with the KEF Blades (we own and love a pair of these), one is astonished at how close this thousand dollar pair of modestly sized speakers gets to a no-cost-no-holds-barred loudspeaker.  With a competent subwoofer system, the difference between these little gems and KEF Reference line models becomes really quite subtle.  Indeed my wife can't hear the difference between these and the Blades without a direct A/B comparison (full disclosure: my wife is not any version of an audiophile).  However, in a direct A/B comparison, they are not embarrassed by the Blades.  Most speakers this size are.

An examination the speaker with its magnetic grill detached reveals why they get so close to the Blades – they are sporting a modified and mass-produced version of the midrange-tweeter integrated assembly from the KEF Reference line and the Blades.  I would say that the R100 is not quite as smooth on vocals, but they have the same kind of amazingly seamless sound of their big brothers (the KEF Reference series and Blades), and at an astonishingly small fraction of the price.  Of course when you get into the Reference Series, you get individually tweaked and tested drivers, a frequency response curve – if you're into that sort of thing – (but if you're spending that kind of money on speakers you probably are into that sort of thing!)

Their midbass and upper bass is actually pretty impressive and convincing, but it's pretty clear the low bass (50-60 Hz and down) is just not there.  Paired with a good subwoofer system, that one easily audible deficiency is mitigated, and you're listening to some rather small speakers that have a very big apparent sound.  The level of fit and finish is remarkable as well.  

These speakers are simply overachievers in every sense of the term, and I would not be surprised if one of the problems for KEF is that the R line is just so good for the money that it is sometimes pulling buyers away from their Reference Series  . . .  And perhaps even from the Blades.

Highly recommended, superbly neutral, and almost 'impossibly good'.
",
10527,1176,Great Speakers,"I had read some reviews of these speakers and based on them decided to purchase them fro my newly set up home theater.  I paired them with the Denon 6400 amp.

First, these speakers are just as thin as I imagined.  They are ultra thin and I was skeptical they would sound as good as my big speaker systems from the 60s and 70s.  Was I ever surprised.  These speakers have ultra clear voice broadcast and sound absolutely great.  I have not fully populated the 11.2 system  with speakers yet, but that will be a future effort.

These speakers sound super great and clear.  I have tried different venues, sports..movies...games and they all sound great.  In addition I was a little concerned with music quality but these speakers have great highs, midw and lows.  Goodbye big bulky speakers.  

The quality of sound is not the only quality of the product.  The brackets that hold them to the wall were very sturdy and have a hole in the bracket to allow the wiring to come in from behind the speaker out of the wall and into the speaker wire clamps.  I purchased some gold plated speaker terminals and they slid right into the speaker female receivers without a problem.  If you run the wires behind the wLL these speakers have a nice clean visual effect.

Finally, the packaging of the speakers was very good and I cannot imagine them getting damaged in shipment.  The installation instructions were clear and easy to follow.",

10530,1264,Stylish speakers with impressive sound,"These are a great set up speakers, with excellent sound and a sleek design. During my research, I learned that these speakers need a ""breaking in"" period of roughly 50 to 60 hours to obtain optimal sound.

10531,1350,Incredible desktop sound!,"I've had 2 pairs of Kef Egg speakers for 1.5 years now. One in my office, one in the boardroom. Every single time I turn them on they amaze me with the performance. I have one paired with a Kef dual subwoofer which really fills in the low end, leaving no frequency underrepresented. The warmth and depth from such a compact design is truly amazing. 

The few changes I would make would be.
1. A longer cable that ties L & R speaker together. I have quite a large desk and the cable is fully extended and not in the perfect place yet. 
2. The remote is quite cheap feeling for premium speakers. It would be great to see a aluminum machined remote or even one with a more premium feel.",

10533,1574,Best bang for buck subwoofer on the market,"If you're looking at KEF then you're probably seeking a certain type of sound quality. You're looking for responsive and tight audio that scales with volume and sounds cleaner than a space satellite construction room. My one concern going into this was that for the $500-$700 range, you wouldn't find a tight and powerful subwoofer as you only start to experience that in the $1200+ range. KEF has surprised me here! The subwoofer remains clean and tight throughout the range without any one frequency droning louder. It has sleek looks to match the quality bass sound. 

I do wish there was a phase dial rather than a 0-180 switch but that's a small concern and shouldn't affect those with ample placement options. I have 2 places that I can put the sub so the sweet spot is off by a few feet but it's not a big deal because it still sounds great. The only reason I am giving this subwoofer a 4/5 for sound quality is because I have heard KEF's Reference 8b subwoofer and wish this sounded a bit more like that. The build quality and value for dollar is excellent though which is why my recommendation is 5/5. 

I went to this from an SVS SB-2000 and think this sounds miles better. 

Cheers and  happy listening!",

If you intend to put the speakers on the floor, you will need to order floorstands (sold in pairs). We ordered a pair of floorstands for the rear speakers,  mounted the center and front speakers on the wall, around the TV, and placed the subwoofer on the floor, next to the media center. The sound quality is awesome but remember that you will need a decent receiver to connect the speakers to.  We are using a 7.2 channels receiver with 4 K capability and Dobly Atmos. I highly recommend those speakers but note those are small speakers. Yet, unless you have a cavernous room, it is more powerful than most people will ever need.",
10536,1163,"Excellent, bought for my in-house music studio.","Equal  to my JBL pro studio monitors but with a better sound stage. To be fair the JBL speakers are near-field and are on the studio desk. The KEF's sound is very open with tight bass, Keep in mind because of their size you need to keep them close enough to each other or you will de-couple the bass. On that same note separate them within the bass coupling limits for optimal sound staging. Running bi-wired until I can get Yamaha amp setup for bi-amping. The Yamaha is set to direct mode which bypasses all tone control circuits. Mine are about 7 feet apart on spiked speaker stands and the bass is very full and tight and as mentioned before the sound staging is incredible. These speakers are a perfect example of ""less is more"" and for the sale price are simply unbeatable.",
10537,1430,Upgrading...,"Having the Xmas sale knock off $100 on a pair of HTS3001 satellite speakers made upgrading my HTS3001 5.1 setup to 7.1 a no-brainer.  Already loved the 5.1 setup, which is perfect for my small family room; cnn't wait to hear this improvement.",
10538,1200,DECENT SOUND . Horrible fit,"Cant get these to fit or stay in my ears . Keep slipping out . Makes sense why they are on sale . I agree with a previous reviewer. Can’t recommend them due to the fit . I even had 2 of friends try them and they couldn’t keep them in their ears . Kept falling out, or more important slipping out  to make the sound quality terrible . Need to fix the fit!!!!!!!!",N
10539,1163,Tremendous Value,"Although many would disagree I tend to prefer good quality vintage loudspeakers - I feel I'm getting better sound for my dollars. However, I decided to give these Q100's a try as the price was so reasonable (assuming they met expectations).  Totally not disappointed. Although not fully broken in yet they have excellent clarity and balance and the mid-range is sweet. ",
10540,1175,"Clean look, crisp sound",I was about to do the in-wall install until I discovered this offering.  Questioned if speakers as thin as these could produce the quality of sound I expected from a home theater setting. Pleasantly surprised at the crisp clear sound and clean look. Very happy with the quality as well. Thumbs up!,
10541,1160,"Great sound, surprisingly full and well rounded","I bought a pair of Q700's as fronts for a home theater (and music listening).  I've been a little surprised by their depth as I expected less out of ~6"" woofers.  However, they are rich, full, and warm.   I had tried a lot of speakers and chose the Q700's over various Klipsch, Polk, and ELAC.  I've been so impressed with their ability to go  loud and big with movies, but subtle and accurate with classical music.  I just purchased additional Q700's to round out the rest of my home theater.  I've been really impressed with KEF's customer service team and their willingness to work with customers.  Thanks so much guys!",
10542,1162,these are great speakers,"the sound is unreal for music & tv that you do not even need a sub.
the highs mid & bass sound great.",
10543,1474,Best sound stage yet," The LS50's deserve their many excellent reviews.   I can say that I agree with every credit and plaudit
they have earned.   I am very pleased with the digital to analog conversion results on my first week's
music streaming.   I had been researching high end DAC equipment, but have put that acquisition on hold
pending auditing all available high end streaming sources.     In my current setup, with the speakers 9 ft.
apart, when I walk toward and between them I can't tell very well where the sound is coming from;  the
speakers have seemingly disappeared.    This is the sound stage I have been looking for.   Good work KEF!",
10544,1162,Fantastic Speakers,When I turned these speakers on they sounded huge. I mean it might be the acoustics of my room but for bookshelfs these fill the room. Bass is extremely tight. This is a lively pair of speakers with extremely clear mids. Currently elated with my purchase thanks kef!,
10545,1264,Amazing,The sound great and look great. Exactly what I needed to fit in with a new 65 inch TV.  Sub puts out great low end. Was not expecting as much due to their size but they really fill out the room.,
10546,1162,"Love the KEF sound-Detailed, accurate and uncolored. What more can you ask for.","Love the sound of my Q300s. I am retired and I have them in my office at home and they slow me down at times when it comes to my production. LOL
",
10547,1531,Natural,"Bought these to replace a set of old Mission 773 floorstanding speakers (which are closer in size to the Q550. After a couple of weeks of listening, I'm definitely thrilled with the purchase. The sound is pure with minimal coloration and, like my old speakers, the soundstage imaging is great (and even better than what I had). Also, the customer service team was incredibly helpful and responsive. ",
10548,1511,Have a star nut installation tool handy.,"The enclosed instructions simply show you attaching the base plates to the leg.  In actuality, you need to drive 8 star nuts into the legs to screw the plates into.  This is not a simple task.   It will be a $30 dollar tool or a DIY tool (see youtube) to accomplish it.  Even if this is the best acoustical method (?), it's lousy that no mention is made of, or description provided, the installation process.  As mentioned in the other review, the top plates are very small for the LS50 speakers and there is no way to affix the stand/speakers.  I'm really disappointed. ",
10549,1509,KEF's standard of great sound.,"I have received many compliments in how my Muo sounds. Full and balanced .
I love the style and colors.I have a blue one and my girlfriend has the pink one.
Well made solid and heavy which speaks quality.",
10550,1572,Great match for LS50,"The smaller 8” driver in the KUBE8b makes it an excellent companion to the KEF LS50. I use it in my home office as a 2.1 system. 
",
10551,1165,A pleasure to ears and eyes,"Great sounding centre channel speaker. Delivers crisp clear dialogue and fills the gap for my amazing Q100 speakers when listening to music. As for looks, this is the centre piece of my home entertainment system. Gorgeous in white! Couldn't be happier for the money spent.",
10552,1350,Excellent speakers with fantastic sound and great connectivity choices.,I bought a pair of these for myself a couple of weeks earlier and liked them so much I decided to get a pair for my teenage son's birthday.  The sound is phenomenal.  No fatigue and a sense of spaciousness that is astounding for a speaker this small.  Even my wife noticed how much better they sounded compared to what used to be in our bedroom.  The connectivity options are fantastic.  I connect via optical from a high end music server.  I am sure my son will use the blutooth.,
10553,1512,Custom single post speaker stands,"Great speaker stands. Well built, solid. Look great with my KEF 50 speakers. ",
10554,1350,Great product but will automatically shut off,"It is indeed a speaker with great sound considering its size. however, it will automatically shut off every 15 min. This is be quite annoying as pc speakers. Hope some sort firmware update could deal with this problem. ",N
10555,1527,Great sound from a small package.,Used in a small home office with Yamaha CD player.   Exceptionally clear vocals.  Easy and pleasant listening experience.,
10556,1566,A must have for your KEF  LS 50s,A beautiful finish and a great supplement to my wonderful sounding LS 50s. Fit and finish is perfect and holds the LS50  perfectly,
10557,1526,Worth Every Penny,Incredible amount of detail while sounding fantastic across all frequencies. Directly compared to a pair of JBL LSR305s and the Q150 are a noticeable upgrade. In a desktop setup you may even be fine without a sub woofer as these are able to deliver an amazing amount of bass for their size.,
10558,1509,"Great speaker, connectivity firmware could use a kick up the arse","The sound quality from the unit is fantastic which is where the problem starts... I was so impressed I bought a second speaker to mate and play stereo and the connectivity really leaves a lot to be desired. Not helped by the fact that the hieroglyphic based manual is completely inadequate for a product of this price and prestige. I have found finally found a method to make the speakers pair reliably and I'm very happy but a friend of mine to whom I recommended this product is still unbelievably frustrated and he's a freaking PhD in neuroscience. Which makes me think I just got lucky. So in summary the speaker. sounds absolutely fantastic and has easily filled the void left by active studio monitors in my large living room, but be prepared for some serious cuss words as you first tried to get stereo speakers paired.",
10559,1528,5 Stars,I'm happy.,
10560,1163,Happy with purchase,Excellent detail and amazing imaging.,
10561,1163,Best Speakers period.,"Sound is very detailed, Supports Bi amping, You can't go wrong with this Speakers.",
10562,1163,Performs as well as other speakers costing much more,"Due to the relocation of my stereo system, I  could no longer use my Paradigm Studio 60s.   The system now sets on a hearth by the fireplace, and is about one foot higher, requiring the speaker to be lower.  I built shorter stands providing at-ear  level listening.  
I began a search for a speaker with front ports.
After many trials with different speakers, I purchased the Kef Q100s.   The sound is well beyond my expectation.  Crisp, clear, with a large sound stage.    No coloration was heard.  I am pleased with their performance. It is much better than others costing much more.  Until now, I had never heard Kef speakers, rather I have always purchased Paradigm.   These actual rival my Studio 60’s.   ",
10563,1163,Wonderful little bookshelf speakers,"Hard to knock these for anything given the price I paid ($300 CAD new). Vocals are amazing, detail is dizzying. Having treble and bass emanating from essentially a single point source really sounds amazing. Tremendous amount of bass for their size too, you can skip the subwoofer for many applications in smaller rooms. But one caveat, these are not great for some kinds of hip-hop... hip-hop tends to expose that tremendous bass as ""one-note bass"". After I heard it, I couldn't un-hear it, I suppose it's the price of the Kef voodoo to get so much bass out of such a small driver and cabinet. Absolutely fantastic for all other applications, but a tough call for hip-hop. Take a listen to the R series or LS50 and you can hear a full range of more realistic bass notes.  But like I said, for this price I don't think there is a better speaker and it's truly a stunning entry point into the world of hifi. ",
10564,1566,"Clean lines, solid build","It wasn't my original intention to purchase KEF-brand stands for my LS50s, but I couldn't find anything else that combined all the same ingredients quite as well: clean line, solid build, good weight, nice finish, ideal listening height, easy cable management, and easy fill. The KEF logo on the base is visible but not overbearing, much like the logo on the speakers themselves. Because the white stands were unavailable, I combined my white LS50s with grey stands to match the grey accent wall in the room. I'm pleased with the result. They neither feel nor look cheap.",
10565,1144,Perfect center channel,"I didn't plan on purchasing a matched center channel for my LS50s, but after a few days with them I knew it was inevitable. Because my center channel requires fairly close placement to the wall,  I found that the bass port insert did help keep dialogue that much more crisp and clear, while allowing me to keep my left and right speakers wide open. Like many home theater users, I've struggled over the years with muddy dialogue, and this arrangement cures that problem handily.",
10566,1163,Excellent sound,I have never had a pair of speakers like these.  Real audiophile sound for the price.   The sound is really clean and clear. Great price as well.,
10567,1163,Everything about these speakers are beautiful,Ya these are real nice.  10/10 would buy again.,
10568,1163,KEF Q100 Walnut speakers--outstanding value,"I was searching for a pair of quality bookshelf speakers for my office, and came across these at the KEF direct site.  I have been a KEF fan for years, and have iQ9 tower speakers and  a matching center channel in a home theater system at home.  The clearance price was very attractive, and the speakers arrived on time.  They look great, and sound even greater.  I am powering them with a Yamaha 2 channel amp with Bluetooth, and the sound is clear, crisp and the imaging characteristics are outstanding.  I'm very pleased with the purchase.",
10569,1509,Big Sound for such a Small Speaker but ...,"I thought it was odd to receive an email to review the product after I returned it, but here goes:

The speaker paired with my iPhone without problems.
It puts out a well balanced sound that is very musical unlike the bass heavy boomy sound of several of its competitors.

However, I purchased the speaker to use with an alarm clock radio app.  The speaker goes to sleep after a period of no use and does not wake up without manual intervention.
It did not make any difference as to whether it was connected with a cable or the blue tooth, once it goes to sleep, it ignores the input.
I contacted customer support hoping there was a firmware update that corrects this, but it's how the speaker was designed.  Energy efficient to a fault.
It's too bad as otherwise it is an excellent speaker.",
10570,1474,The future of Hi-Fi,"I have owned the passive model before and am quite familiar with the character and tone of this speaker. When the active (wireless) version was being announced, I knew eventually I had to purchase a pair. That happened a month ago. I have been very pleased! There is a noticeable improvement over the passive versions. They have better drive and convey emotional texture better, with a punchier sound and more extended bass.

Not only do they sound better (which is a huge achievement as the passive LS50 is an excellent product), but they allow for deep versatility that is not possible with a typical loudspeaker. I will echo the sentiments of the other people about the app - using streaming with the app is clunky, disorganized and frustrating. Thankfully Spotify does not use the KEF app, but I do not recommend using the KEF app to browse your music library. Instead, my suggestion is to use Roon. This takes the LS50 to an entirely new level, improving usability and functionality to an extent I did not think possible. For years, I have wanted to find a solution where I could remove all of the components in my listening space, and only have the speakers. With the LS50 Wireless speakers and Roon, this is a possibility. I have a computer in another room acting as the ""Core"", and the LS50s natively tap into that core and you can use the Roon app on your phone or tablet to browse your music library. In addition to that, Roon brings about a couple of other important features - a sliding volume control for the LS50s, a gripe I have with the KEF app, and also the ability to run an intelligent DSP. I use multiple subwoofers with my LS50s, and a parametric equalizer is important to achieve a flat bass response. Not only is the system smart and intelligent, it is highly functional and with removing all of the components in my space, I have reduced the amount of reflection points with no gear rack in the room and also with no computer or other components I have reduced the ambient noise in the room.

To me, this is the future of high fidelity. Some enjoy having the flexibility of a component system and want to swap things in and out, or go full old school and even use a record player. While that is certainly an appealing option, to me the ultimate use of the LS50 Wireless is through the use of Roon, an intelligent media player, with the beautiful flexibility of the Roon app, its excellent metadata and no requirement for an endpoint to connect to the LS50s. Yes, Roon is not cheap, but at $120/year that works out to $10/month, a worthy expense.

In short, should you choose the LS50 Wireless, I would highly suggest using Roon with them. However, even if you do not pursue that option, it is flexible enough to be used in a variety of other ways. It is an excellent product, with only a few small flaws on the software side. Highly recommended.",
10571,1163,What a pleasure!,"We had a pair of KEF Reference speakers for many years that we no longer have space for; giving our brother-in-law custody of them was one of the hardest things I've ever had to do, and I'm not even an audiophile. When we needed to replace our bookshelf speakers, we looked at KEF first, and at the sale price these were a no-brainer.  We set them up, cranked them up, and a sense of relief washed over me -- literally my first thought was, ""God, I've missed the KEFs!"" The clarity and balance of the sound is such a pleasure, I've still never experienced anything like it.  ",
10572,1573,Most musical sub!,"I have a larger, more powerful subwoofer from another manufacturer in my main system. I needed a more compact one for my office setup, to augment my KEF LS50's. I'm shocked at the quality of this unit's sound. It's fast attack and rapid decay is rare in a sub at this cost level, making it a bargain. It absolutely pounds me when asked, keeping right up with the LS50's in seamless harmony. I now want to replace the one on my main system with it's bigger brother, the Kube 12b!",
10573,1200,design makes a good fit impossible,"I like the sound when I can get the buds to fit properly, which is almost never.   The attached ear-hooks make a proper fit, which is difficult for me anyway because I need the largest tips, almost impossible.   I love other KEF products, so this was a serious disappointment.",
10574,1193,"Great, clean, crisp detailed sound","These are really great in-wall speakers - I was looking at mid/higher end  B&W and Martin Logans among others for built-ins.  I have these plus the same in the 160mm version in another room (space constraints).   They both sound great - basically indistinguishable.   

I like a clean, high-detail sound and these deliver -- I like the KEF sound.  As a reference,  Martin Logans are not my thing (too ""soft"", not crisp) but B&Ws generally sound good to me with the higher price speakers definitely delivering better sound for me).    My other reference is a set of KRK VXT-8 studio monitors.  Like other mid/higher-end KEF speakers I've listened to, these are the kinds of speakers where you can hear those little details that get lost on most crummy speakers - a vocalist drawing a quick breath, a brush of the fingers on the strings, a soft little brush back-beat on the drums behind everything else.    

 The bass on both this 200mm and the 160mm version is also very good - that is immediately apparent.  Unlike most in-wall speakers that are designed for use as part of a THX-type  AV system with a subwoofer, these seemed to be designed for hi-fi stereo audio and are rated down to 35khz (38khz for the 160s).      I am driving them with a JAMO/Klipsch DSP 500, type g/h DSP amp, 125w/channel x 4 with the DSP equalizer at neutral.  (That also happens to be a nice piece of hardware....)

All good, nothing bad.  ",
10575,1199,"So-so, for the price","Sound quality was quite ample on mid range (not so airy, though), a bit muffled on the highs, with practically non extant bass. Bass guitar was sounded like a regular 6-string one. Returned them after a week of listening, with some restocking fee paid.",
10576,1143,poor workmanship,"Sound is great, if not fantastic, for even spacious rooms, but the workmanship is quite poor: discoloration appeared on both mid-low and high speakers and, sadly, in two different tones, so I have two concentric shades on them. Additionally, one mid-low had to be replaced, as the foil started breaking apart in multiple places.",N
10577,1163,5 Star's,"Got these on sale for $ 250 through KEF store and what a bargain. After about 100 hours of break-in these speakers sound fantastic. Great bass response, mids and highs are good too. Paired with a good amp you will be impressed. ",
10578,1150,Amazing,Best speakers I ever owned.,
10579,1200,Nice sound.,They sound great.. They do not stay in my ear. Wish there was a way to order a smaller size so the earpiece would fit in my ear.,
10580,1474,Terrific sonic qualites......,"..... easy on the ear and eyes as well. Crisp, tight, well balanced audio, with high that sparkle and bass beyond what I expected from a speaker of this size. Listening is a delight!

I chose the wireless version because of the simplicity and convenience of an integrated system. For listener convenience it missed the mark by a mile. App needs work, remote is not illuminated,  status(power, modes) are only visible by looking down upon the speaker... not even a power on front light! I expect more from great company like KEF",
10581,1200,Great headphones,"Bought 1 last few months, it is really a great headphone, so just bought 2 more ;D. However the button of the controls is a little bit hard to press.",
10582,1143,"great speakers, especially at the price","My second pair of LS50s, these will replace a pair of Vandersteen 2C speakers.  In side-by-side listening, the KEFs are clearly more transparent, and they take up less real estate.",
10583,1209,"Good, but not great ",I had 4 8 inch Kef in ceiling speakers installed in my bedroom and they freaking rock! But I’m underwhelmed by this single speaker in my bathroom. I need to give it a break because it is water resistant so what  the heck do I expect?!?,N

10585,1514,Pretty good floor protectors.,"Look, they are not the flashiest, or most robust, but... they do exactly what they say they will at an affordable price. They keep the spikes on my speakers from damaging my wooden floors, and provide some acoustic isolation. I will buy more for my other floorstanders. ",
10586,1170,Amazing sound from such a thin speaker,"I have a T101C as my center channel with Q100s flanking it as L/R.  The depth and weight of the sound that comes out of this super-thin speaker is amazing.  I admit.  I was skeptical at first.  Then I ran Audyssey to calibrate it, and I was more than impressed.  If you get one expecting it to be an R600C, you will be disappointed.  But if you have a moderate setup, this will be more than enough.",
10587,1163,Little speaker - Big sound,Impressed with that speakers of this smaller size can deliver so much good sound.  Perfect for my desire to downsize physical speaker size and the front facing port makes it possible - they fit my needs like a glove.,
10589,1158,Amazing bass!!!,"I am running R900s as fronts and R300s as rears in my master bedroom. Got them this winter and they are amazing!   I also have the R600 center channel and the R400 subwoofer.  I love putting guests in my bed where it’s all geared.  They sit there with their mouths hanging open.   When I move from crisp clear rock sounds  to deep bass stuff like bass test “songs”, this sub vibrates and shakes my bed and really the whole room.  People go nuts!!!  I do too!!  

Clearly, this is the best system I have ever had. I used to think my Cerwin Vegas and Polk Audios were awesome.  Not in the same arena with these.  I’m already itching to upgrade to Reference!!  But then I ask myself why?  Could they really be THAT much better than this?  Are my ears capable of discerning any better balanced sound and clarity?  
So... back to the point here, if you want to truly rock your world, buy this subwoofer!!! ",
10591,1527,Great!,"These speakers are among the best in class in this price bracket.  For me, they sound wonderful.
Clear, precise, easily integrated with other components. 
They look stunning too. I understand why they're not shipped with covers, who want to cover that lovely face!?
Please note they're quite deep for a bookshelf speaker, if you're looking for something compact... ",
10592,1572,Great size and enough deep punch,Great deep sound with enough punch to get perfectly along with the LS50 system. Size is ideal to find a place. I definitely can recommend the Kube 8b,
10608,1152,Great speaker,"After a few weeks off listening, I am very happy with performance of that speaker. It is connected to Marantz HD-AMP1 amplifier and HD-CD1 player. Sound is super clear and natural to my ears.I was worried about bass , however was very pleased with it. I  don't think that I will add subwoofer.",
10610,1532,Worth the investment,"After years of satisfaction with my vintage EPI 360's, it was time to update.
After considerable reviews and listening rooms, the Q950's were selected.
The separation, and wide dispersion brings the subtle nuances within the music to notice.
Well worth my time and money.  ",
10611,1150,Very good speaker,These are wonderful; although I prefer my R900’s.,
10612,1200,Great earphones,"Good sound, bass could be stronger though. Earphones wouldn’t be recommended for people with small ears or people aged below 14/15. ",
10614,1574,Hands down the best relatively compact sub,"I was looking for a relatively small sub for my medium sized basement home theater. I needed some extra low end reach for my Goldenear Triton Three speakers and surrounds. The KEF fits the bill perfectly, even the matches the look with the gloss top and fabric sides. The KEF is an understated sub that does not draw much attention, which is good for the decor and spouse approval.  As for performance, it is unbelievable! Now movies and music have some extra depth (but not bloat) from the Kube 12b.  The real world measurements are impressive.  In my room, I can get a FLAT corrected EQ curve to 15Hz at about 75db  from Anthem Room Correction, WOW! I did a head to head with an SVS SB 2000 and the Kube12b produced 7-8db louder response from 15-25 Hz which is exactly where I want more output.  The corrected sub EQ curve for the SVS tailed off at about 18 Hz.  Needless to say I kept the KEF.  This is the best relatively compact sub hands down that won't overwhelm a room with its size!",
10615,1635,Excellent!,Just picked these up from my local Best Buy and they sound awesome. Major improvement compared to my old X300As. LS50 Wireless replaced my stereo in the living room and LSX has now become the only desktop speaker I will use.,
10616,1635,"Sounds good, compact, pricey","Very good speakers, the red cloth is nice, could be a bit cheaper. ",
10617,1635,Worth Every Penny,"I've had my eyes on KEF for years and finally decided to make the leap after noticing these speakers. I couldn't be happier with the decision. Keep up the great work, team KEF, I think you've earned a lifelong customer. Best wishes.",
10620,1200,Very disappointing,"These are clearly not $200 headphones, they are not $50 headphones (the price I paid on sale). They don't match at all the quality of the Phiaton's I have. I really wanted to love them, but don't. ",
10621,1474,"Excellent midrange and soundstage, apps need work. ","Most reviews on these speakers are spot on. The midrange and soundstage is clear and large. Female voices, guitars, and violins sounds extremely detail. Configuring the DSP will make the speaker's low end sound fuller. The only knock on these speakers is the iOS/Android app. There is a delay when selecting songs and it tends to be fickly displaying incorrect information. The beta gapless feature works some of the time. Hopefully that will be fix in future updates. I have these set in a 14X18 bedroom and it fills the room nicely. These speakers likes to play loud. At low volume the speaker doesn't show its full potential. I listen to a variety of music (classical, acoustic, jazz, rock). I highly recommend them if you want an all in one solution. ",
10622,1594,Amazing speakers- a must buy!,"I have owned LS-50s for a few years and decided to get the wireless LS50W for my bedroom. Amazing speakers straight out of the box and easy set up..  Phenomenal clarity - it sounds like the musicians are literally playing in my room. Great for any and all types of music- jass, rock, hip hop, classical, world music. I could not assemble a better setup for under $25K than this.",
10623,1526,Great speaker all-around for the money,"Let me say especially at the current price at $300/pair, these Q150s offer a very solid product in terms of build quality, aesthetics, sound quality, and respond to a fuss free approach to placement and setup.

I would have liked to see the grilles included like with most speakers but these speakers look great without grilles with no visible screws or pin cups thanks to the magnetic grille design. My ratings for price and value are based on the regular MSRP. At the price I paid, I would give 5 stars all-around.

The only potential downside sound wise I can think of is that dialogue/vocals need some volume to sound their best. Not an issue for HT use or music at a moderate volume, just low level night or background music listening. On the flip side, these speakers aren't fatiguing or bright in any way and so listening at somewhat loud levels is very pleasant. Treble is very smooth and extended.

My previous speakers include SVS Prime bookshelves and center and Sony Core bookshelves and center before that. These Q150s are a lot better in most ways than both and I have 5 of them paired with a sealed Rythmik L12 sub and Yamaha Aventage RX-A2070 AVR in a bedroom 5.1 HT setup. Given the very small and sealed nature of my room (~1200 cu ft), this setup is very powerful and I don’t need to go past -30dB MV on the Yamaha to fill the room with very clear, precise, and powerful sound. I found using the supplied port plugs to turn these into sealed speakers with a global 100Hz crossover in the AVR produced the best bass response in my room.",
10624,1198,Extremely midrange with no bass or treble notes,"I was so happy to find these shallow depth In-ceiling speakers however,  the sound they delivered was extremely midrange with no bass or treble notes and sounded defective. I connected Ci160TR speakers to the Denon receiver that would be powering them and compared them to bookshelf and tower speakers. I was told by Kef Support that they would have more bass when installed. I did not want to cut holes in my new kitchen ceiling only to find it was not true.  So I cut a hole in a large cardboard box to test their claim of more bass when installed. There was no bass difference whatsoever.

I was so disappointed by the sound that I ordered a set of shallow depth speakers from another vendor. The sound quality far exceeds that of the Kef speakers in both bass and treble and they are only 2 inches deep with a back-box. I had to repackage the Kef speakers and pay the return shipping cost.  Kef Support let me know the speakers were not defective and they would not be refunding a $97.45 restocking fee.",
10625,1531,Incredibly balanced/neutral & very high resolution,"Incredibly balanced/neutral & very high resolution

Bass is tight and punchy, mids are neutral and the highs/resolution is exceptionally good for a speaker at this price-point! Example, when listening to John Mayers - Gravity live (where the light is) you can hear the 60hz cycle noise from the lights/equipment/amps etc on stage as if he was playing 6 feet in front of you. With other speakers/headphones you may pickup a fraction of this detail in the song but nowhere clear as the Q750's.

Massive sound-stage and pinpoint imaging. They throw an amazing holographic/3d sound-stage, sometimes it feels like i left my surround sound on when i'm playing 2.0 channels. (placement is crucial here though)

They really love/shine with quality power (150w +) but they do an adequate job with 80w as long as you're not pushing the volume. The more/quality power you feed the better it gets with Q750's.

Extreme basshead's may want to look at the Q950's but ""audiophiles types"" will be very contented with the Q750's bass output. I love deep/punchy/clean bass but i wouldn't consider myself a ""bass-head"" and the Q750 makes me smile!

This is the most balanced/neutral speaker i have ever listened to and i mean that in a positive way. The Q750 won't add color to your sound and are true to the recording.

overall i'm 100% satisfied with these and can't wait to add a couple mono-block amplifiers behind them!",
10626,1574,"Sound quality is outstanding, and flat BELOW 20 HZ!","I'm currently running dual KEF Kube 12b subs and could not be happier. I think their sound quality is outstanding, and they'll play flat BELOW 20 HZ! They perform better than their specs say they should, with many other products it's the opposite. If you're looking for a subsonic subwoofer for music and home theater, you should check the KEF Kube 12b out. I think it's a truly incredible buy.",

10628,1231,KEF C-1 Speakers are Great for desktop stereo!!,Just got the C-1's on sale.  They are handsome and sound clear as light.  They are more than enough for the desk. I have 50 watt amp driving them. They put out good bass for size and make voices sound natural. Good with music.   High recommendation!,
10629,1343,Worst headphones ever for money paid,Quality of sound is great however in just a year the headset itself has fallen apart. I love my headset but I’m sad to say they didn’t pass the durability test. In a year I’ve to replace the cable. The black leatherette has started to break on the headband section and now the leatherette has split open on my ear piece exposing the sponge for the ear. Very disappointed considering the price. Yes I understand they’re not the most expensive but they aren’t cheap either.,N
10630,1526,Q150's are Very Good Speakers,I use my Q150's for desktop computer set up.  I have small 50 watt amp driving them with flac files.  Excellent sound.  They really shine with jazz and classical piano. Voices are well done.  The KEF Q150's are balanced from top to bottom.  I like the grills to protect them from my soda fizz spray. The speaker covers are magnetic and look good in black oak.  Recommended.,
10631,1532,Musical Nirvana,"I am an economically constrained audiophile. That is to say that I can recognize good quality sound but my purchasing is restricted by my financial limitations.
This is the very first time that you will see a review of this amplifier paired with these particular speakers anywhere.
Ah well, nothing ventured, nothing gained.
And what a gamble it was.....and I hit the jackpot!
I have been on the hunt for a nice stereo system since I was 21 years of age.
At 67, I can unreservedly state that I have finally achieved auditory Nirvana!
Oh! Where do I begin?......
The NAD C388 is rated for a conservative continuous power output of 150 Watts per channel at 8 Ohms of impedance. Whilst the KEF Q950 speakers are a perfect match, rated for an amplifier between 15 and 200 Watts. My newly acquired speakers have finally met and married the perfect amplifier. 

Those who are in the market for, or already own this remarkable amplifier have no idea what lies in wait for them, until they pair it up with these wonderfully capable speakers. These KEF Q950s are worth every hard earned penny I have expended on them.

The rich velvet-smooth bass (from what reviews that I have read, the lack of bass is a common but incorrect complaint of the NAD C388 Amplifier. It just requires good speakers) and soprano type treble and the alto like mid range conspire to give you a musical experience that is heavenly.
In fact bass and treble had to be turned down to “flat” and the now utterly redundant sub woofer, disconnected!
I can without reservation, absolutely recommend the marriage between a NAD C388 Amplifier and a set of KEF Q950 English speakers.
If you like me, love listening to distortion free music of any type at any volume, look no further.

10632,1526,KEF Q150 is Great Desktop Speaker!!,I have had the KEF Q150 for about four months.  I use it at my computer desk with 50 watt integrated amp.  My main source are my computer music files.  The sound is very natural and well balanced.  It plays what is on the recording.  Grand piano and violin sound wonderful. I use also for my old rock music like the Stones and the Beatles.  Bass is tight and tuneful.  Like that the speakers are not too big.  Well recommended.,

10645,1143,An unexpected surprise. Fantastic!,"I'm a recording engineer specializing in, acoustic, music, mostly classical and jazz. A colleague of mine, who owns a Hi F store, had purchased a set of LS50s, for himself, brand new, in Red, and then decided he wanted the wireless version instead. He put The Reds up for sale and I took them home to listen as a possible replacement monitor at my audio editing station. I used a spare Bel Canto amp to power them. These LS50s absolutely floored me, I wasn't prepared for what I heard. I never returned them and didn't even hassle him for a better price. Even the red color was very cool. But the most important thing was the sound, especially the detail, imaging, and tonal accuracy. I was able to hear far more than previously, and make reliable mastering decisions that translated well to any system in my home, as well as others out in the real world. These things are sleepers, and I'm curious as to why I haven't heard more about them, from other audio professionals. I also love listening to them for simple non-critical enjoyment. I'm now considering a pair of R3s for my studio near-field monitors. I need the increased bass response, and I'm not a big fan of sub-woofers.  ",

But I could not find a pair of wall mounts that would securely & confidently support these speaker from the base. Given the time I spent searching for alternatives, I finally pulled the plug on these once they were announced. Packaging & instructions are great. The construction is great. Very clean design - the mounts look great and work great. These are fantastic mounts. Specific to these speakers? Well, they are certainly specific to bottom mount speakers, which seem to be rare. So, yeah, they may not work on others. But I love the LSX so they work for me! Highly recommended. ",

10649,1631,These are Excellent speakers.,"The Kef R11 is a significant upgrade to almost any system. Clear sound, tight vocals, and flat balanced bass response. These speakers are perfectly poised for music and movies. I compared them to B&W and the new Martin Logan Motion XTi 60. It was a tough decision because the sound quality of all three is exceptional. I was leaning towards the Logans however made a decision base on the bass response.  The only small complaint is that they sound muffled on low volume. You have to crank the capacity to get them to perform — otherwise, great speakers.

While I tend to be frugal with my spending, these speakers are work of art and worth the price.",
10650,1474,"Great sound, but the app can drive you to despair. ","Overall, I concur with the other reviewers: The sound is wonderful (detail and clarity are just jawdroppingly good, and the app, especially the STREAMING app is the bane of my existence. I have had to delete and restore it about 5 times since August. Also, when I was first setting up the wireless capacities, it just failed and failed. Turns out the KEF system is incompatible with Google wi-fi. So, it's now paired with the Comcast wi-fi, which is glitchy, but compatible. These frustrations are off-set by the stellar sound, but they don't get a ""Pass"" with me. ",N

The ""instructions"" are printed on the box and there is one critical item that seems to be overlooked regarding steps for angling the bracket plate. There are two very tiny screws that seem to govern the plate angle (in addition to the screws on each side of the plate.  Furthermore, I installed these on a sloped ceiling and desired to maintain the bottom plate level with the arm. However, the plate slowly began tiling under the weight of the speaker to its maximum of 40 degrees. It required Herculean strength to tighten the screws to maintain their angle and I'm not convinced they will hold.  Also there seemed to be defects in two of the Allen fittings.  I was afraid I was going to strip the included Allen wrenches. These are fantastic speakers and deserve better. ",N

10659,1136,Feels like a private concert in Sunnyvale,"Let me start by saying i dont know a lot about technical sound stuff. What i do know is that these bad boys rattled the water stained wallpaper off my trailers living room walls without any helo from me. They get loud. Which is good. 
 The thing that impressed me most is the chrome parts. They take the day to day needs of life without any issues.  From dealing with high moisture from the many many plants i grow in my indoor garden, to being used as a permanent soundstage for my Skynyrd next to the above ground pool in the backyard. The chrome still looks like new as the trailer hitch ball on city folks pickups. 
  Not sure what resale is like on a product like these but the guy at the pawn shop said they would give me 5grand no question. So thats not too bad.

10660,1342,Great Value,"At the $39.99 price tag these are a steal. 
- super comfortable and they stay put. Also found they are quite comfortable when lying down which cannot be said for most in ears.

- good cord length
- sound quality. These are not going to please everyone. They are not hi volume bass blasting headphones. They, in my opinion, reproduce the recording, mixing and mastering of material faithfully revealing more of what the artists intended. Great soundstage with these as well. No harshness or audio fatigue. Crisp highs and no washy low end.

10662,1474,"Great speakers, But hi-res streaming - not so great","Ditto just about every other review you will read about the KEF LS50 Wireless speakers. They are wonderful. Which is why the Streaming app is so jaw-dropping disappointing. When playing an album from my own files - it sorts the tracks in alphabetical order! What kind of app is released with such a fundamental flaw in it? The app also drains my phone battery like crazy if I fail to close it when not using it. The speakers are definitely worth it, but be prepared to spend extra money to get streaming that is of equal quality. (And be aware that the two speakers are connected by wire- this may impact how you are able to place them.)",
10663,1350,DO NOT BUY FOR PC USE: You have to power speakers on every time you want to use them.,"The speakers do not detect the PC when it powers up. You have to separately power the speakers on and manually change modes if it was last used for a bluetooth. On top of that, if audio is already playing on the PC when you power the speakers on, they power themselves back off. Really wish a firmware update was available to correct this. DO NOT BUY FOR USE WITH A PC!!!!!!",N
10664,1635,"Great sounding speakers, but unfortunately do not function well wirelessly","I absolutely love how these speakers sound. I still can't get over the depth and quality of the bass and lower mid-range. My gripe with these speakers however is that the left speaker continuously cuts in and out when connected wirelessly. Cabling the speakers works, but these are advertised as wireless speakers and so I expect them to function wirelessly. Beware that you will need to link the left and right speakers if you don't want to experience continuous cutouts.

Note from KEF: Thank you for your thoughtful review John. We would like to note, wireless connectivity between the two speakers can be interrupted due to addition electronics interfering with the signal between both speakers. Unfortunately this is a downside of having electronics between two speakers communicating with the wireless option enabled. ",
10665,1635,Awesome but Airplay 2 sound not really good,"I really love this pair of speakers, the sound compare to any other speakers I have owned is way better and simple amazing!! I would like say a couple of things about them. 1) I am not an expert of the Airplay2 protocol but I've been using it a lot since it was released  last year, At first I was not very happy with it, it was not functioning correctly, it was crashing a lot and make the LSX irresponsive in a such degree that I had to disconnect them from the power to make them work again. Finally I fixed the problem by connecting them to a 5Ghz Wireless network, now the airplay2 mode works really good...BUT I've noticed the sound is not the best, I can hear a little bit of noise (do not how to explain it but it is kind of a vinyl type of noise),  at first I thought it was part of recording but then I tried the same song with different input (optical in) and I could not replicated, I am not sure if it is a Airplay2 thing or a KEF problem. I have one thing, I was experiencing a tiny  noticeable delya on an external subwoofer in the wireless mode (not happening if the speaker  are connected to each other with the ethernet cable).",
10666,1143,Outstanding,"For the money, you are unlikely to find a better pair of monitors. Make sure to place them on stands and be careful in their placement. The sound is incredible. Detailed, encompassing. No regrets. ",
10667,1474,Unbelievably great speakers ... with an awful remote and a hyper-buggy streaming app,"I've been listening to the LS50Ws for three days straight now; I find it hard to tear myself away. The speakers sit on the far corners of my desk, on seven-inch-tall IsoAcoustics Aperta isolation stands — about eight inches from the wall, and three to four feet from my listening position. In other words, I'm using them as near-field monitors.

Truthfully, I'm thrilled with the clarity and harmonic ""rightness"" of these KEFs, as well as with the excellent dynamics; the width and depth of the soundstage; and with the authority and muscularity of the lower frequencies. Despite the modest size of the cabinets, the bass reaches effortlessly down into the 40Hz region. The great customizability of the DSP settings allows you to tune the speakers to your room with surprisingly little effort.

The LS50Ws are truly the whole package.  I love that they form a complete, self-contained music system, doing away with (indeed, preventing) the obsessive search for just the right DAC, preamp, amp, and cables to pair them with. All you need is a source (CD player, iPhone, computer, digital streamer, etc,) What you see and hear is what you get, and it's sonically STELLAR, easily rivaling systems twice or thrice the cost.

The speakers are also, to my eye, wonderfully designed, clearly manufactured to high standards, and beautifully finished.

Detracting from my very high regard for this product is the remote control. I could perhaps forgive KEF for making it out of cheap-feeling plastic, but not for the complete lack of ergonomics. The handfeel of this wretched thing is as bad as it gets. Without carefully studying the surface, you can't tell which is the front and which the back, or which side is up and which side down. This is greatly compounded by the asinine color scheme. A child would understand that dark red text printed on black plastic is virtually illegible even during the day, let alone at night. I've already replaced KEF's utterly inadequate effort with a 10-dollar Chinese learning remote that, though it's on the ugly side, at least lets me see AND feel what I'm doing. After five minutes, I could operate it by touch. Problem solved.

To continue with my very brief list of negatives, the KEF streaming app is hyper-buggy, with frequent dropouts and errors beyond anything I've experienced with other audio software,. I've never heard my music slowed down drastically in tempo, but that's the effect I got from time to time during my first hour of using the app. Complaints about this nonsense date back to the launch of LS50Ws back in 2016; hard to believe that a company of KEF's stature has been unable or unwilling to fix it. 

Thankfully, KEF Control, the companion app that lets you pause, play, fast forward, etc, as well as tweak DSP / room-correction settings, works without glitching, at least on my iPhone X.

Remote and streaming app aside, KEF knocked it out of the park and into the stratosphere with the LS50Ws. These impressive speakers do everything right, as they put you in touch with your music. I fell in love with my favorite tracks all over again. Nothing else in this price category comes even close.

10668,1184,Surprisingly great!!!!,"We decided to finish our basement last year, and these became part of the adventure.  Well worth it!  The local Best Buy rep was fast to tell me about these speakers, as we had a room that was 14' wide, by 42' long.  but we didn't want to close the space down with towers.  We almost went with the R3's in some shelves around our 120"" projection screen, but we were worried they would get distorted being in 24""x 24""x 48"" recessed shelf niches.   
Since they didn't have any Ci5160's, or 30's to test, we kinda took the leap of faith with these, after listening to the R11's they had.  They say that they are just like the towers, or at least based on the design of them.  I am glad that we went this direction to get better sound.  The B&W speakers sounded to high at times for us.  This is our first jump into a better HiFi system, as we just have some Harmon Kardon wifi speakers that have been our Hi-Fi experience, and a Klipsch & Yamaha theater system upstairs, thus far.  After setting up our system ( Marantz 6013 AVR, (2) 5160's, (1) 3160 ( actually, I wanted to do another 5160 as a center, but budget said no.

It was like moving up to a HD Plasma or 4k tv for the first time, and realizing that life is so much more better now.
I had fun installing them myself.  We did install our front 3 speakers horizontally below the screen, instead of hiding them behind an expensive perforated screen.  Since they were in a built-out / furred wall that was almost 3' out from the foundation wall (basically a small crawl space were there would be no sound compression (not sure if I am describing it technically correctly), I decided to make back boxes for most of the speakers. I used 1/2"" MDF and followed the ""Minimum air space requirements"" that they have available to make the sizes correct for each speaker.  We used Audioquest 14/4 speaker wires (twisted together) from the AVR.  

Our next project is to determine if we should get more power to them via 2nd amp (Marantz or Arcam), or just upgrade to a new Denon 8500 AVR.  As of right now, The system sounds GREAT as is, but could there be more to get out of these speakers....?
  
I laugh at this experience, as I originally went in there looking for theater speakers, and nothing more, now I find myself wanting more HiFi music experiences as well, because it sounds that great.

I will admit, at first, I was that kid that wanted everything to sound bassy, and the house to move on every note; so I was slightly disappointed when the Marantz AVR did its calibration setup, and had the subs (using an old Sony sub on the right side) at lower levels.  It didn't rock the house on every note!  So... I turned those channels up, only to find that I really didn't want to hear that much bass in everything.  I took it back down to the calibrated settings again, and put the crossover at 60, and watched an action movie.  The house moved when it needed to,  It sounds and feels great!!!  One movie that really moved me was ""T-34"", a tank movie.  Previously serving in the Army, that movie took me back to my days as a tanker.  It was great!! The ""FEEL"" of the shots, impacts, droning engine, tracks, etc, was so realistic!!  This sub gave me exactly what I needed.
And yes, at some point I will replace the old Sony sub, to make a Kef 12b duo.  It looks classy too.  ",
10673,1635,Everything I’d Expected,"I’ve read every review at every reputable audiophile site. They said everything. Yeah, what they said. Stereophile. What HiFi. They said it. I decided believe it. I bought them. I’m overjoyed with this purchase.",
10674,1566,white stands,Got these from a dealer at a reduced price. Easy to assemble. Look and feel very nice. Ordered some discs to protect the floor.,
10675,1474,"Fantastic sound, ruined by terrible apps","I have had these speakers for nearly two years and have been impressed with the sound quality and believe these to be well designed, well made speakers. I have paired these with a HSU sub and have calibrated the sub and treble outputs. For the most part, i have used either USB or optical connections, which have worked well. I cannot however recommend this product due to the appalling quality of the KEF control app, which is the worst app I have ever used on iPhone. As others have described, the app seldom seems to be able to connect to the speakers; furthermore, as I recently upgraded my wireless router to a Netgear Nighthawk model, I struggled to connect the speakers to WiFi. The app would find the speakers but then fail time after time to connect. I was finally able to make a connection but ultimately only the 2.4 GHz network was enabled despite connecting to the 5G network. I will stick to the PC connection from now on...the wireless capability is not worth the bother.",
10676,1566,olsdog,"I purchased these stands to go with my new R3s and it turns out that the mounting plate is too small for R3s. They were clearly made for a smaller speaker even though there are displayed all over KEFs ads with them. KEF should be offering a top mounting plate that works with each speaker. As it is, I'm either supposed to just sit them on top of a small plate unattached, or have some plates made and finished to modify them in a way KEF should have. For such a high end product, this is disappointing to say the least.",
10677,1531,The DNA of Audio Refinement,"I worked around aircraft for many years and have a constant ringing in my ears around 1.5 – 2 kHz. Speakers greater than $2K each quality would be beyond my ability to appreciate. The Q750 quality exceeds their price point.
My application of the Q750 are 2-ch music only and the lack of a bass reflex port made them perfect in my 10 x 10 open concept room (3 walls only). My source is a Pioneer Elite PD-65 CD Player using its internal DAC connected analog to my Pioneer Elite M-72 Power Amp (some would consider the CD player and amp vintage).
I was not able to hear the KEF Q750 in my listening space or at the reseller. I relied on reviews and specifications to make my purchase decision. Fortunately, the reviews (which weren’t many) was accurate, they are perfect for my listening space and the music I love.
I listen to two genres of music, Jazz and Smooth Jazz, but a variety of categories from brass to vocals to bass guitar. I listened to a Harry Connick Jr piece that had the big band accompaniment, lots of trumpets and trombones and they were bright not brittle! Vocals and midrange are spot on. The sound stage is perfect. The low end is crisp and fast. There is a caveat here, in Jazz most of the Instruments lowest frequency is 40 Hz and the Q750 does very well reproducing the bass violin. Of course, Jazz Organist can reach the bottom of the frequency range with foot pedals at 12 Hz and the KEF Q750 won’t replay that. So, if you’re going to listen to a pipe organ or place the KEF Q750 in a movie environment, you’ll need subwoofers to get the lowest frequencies and the thump of a car explosion.
I know that there aren’t many stereo listeners anymore, but if you have a dedicated music listening space that is small and you are trying to decide on bookshelves with a sub or small floor standers, get the KEF Q750! I think the Q750 are more genetically related to the R-Series and Reference Line than either the Q950 or Q550 because of the UNI-Q and LF drivers’ similarities! You won’t be disappointed with a pair of the KEF Q750!!!

10678,1631,Fantastic Sound,"My KEF 107/2 at 28 years old needed alot of attention. I decided they needed to go to a new home where they could be rebuilt. As a lover of the KEF sound I called a friend who also is a KEF person told him my plans he told me listen to the R11's. With the situation could not go to his house or store to listen. Took his recommendation and ordered the R11.  Wow just as I stated and he told me they are fantastic meet all my criteria. Clean clear sound voices and tight natural base nothing added and nothing missing! Just a point about my wife first impression she said to me ""why do you have the center channel on."" I showed I did NOT the image they create is spot on. I set the up according to instruction both toed in at angle equal to the ten ft spread.  Don't miss out by not hearing them. My wife and I play music all day absolutely no listening fatigue! And the blacks are really sharp! All looks are cool.",
10679,1216,Ci130qs,"So I finished my basement with the intent of using hanging cube speakers as rear surrounds so I installed j boxes to mount brackets.  But after listening to some of them I was really unimpressed.  So I was looking for a sqaure ceiling speaker that I could use in the sqaure holes I have already put in the ceiling.  I have to say I had a hard time finding much on these speakers on the internet besides typical specs,  but they were what I was looking for and some people seem to like them. I installed them yesterday and first of all A+ on packaging I love when products are package well nothing worse than waiting for some item and it shows up damaged so kudos!  Next them product was manufactured very well fit and finish was top notch.  Easy installation they sound great and look great.  The only negetives are they are a bit pricey and sensitivity is a little less then I was looking for.  All in all pretty happy so far plannig on getting two more for side channles.  p.s.  I have a RX780 Yamaha reciever with psb alpha 5 front and center channels and a pb1000 svs sub.",
10680,1635,Terrible wireless experience,"I brought 4 pair of these speakers. They sound good and look great. Unfortunately, in a house with excellent WiFi strength and speed in all corners, I can’t get these things connected and working with AirPlay 2 in a stable way.  I have a home full of connected devices that work continuously and stable, including streaming devices, except for theses LSX speakers.  They drop out out, they stop, and in between they sound great.  Extremely frustrating. I keep waiting for an update or some solution on line. At this point, I’d like to hear from KEF on this. ",N
