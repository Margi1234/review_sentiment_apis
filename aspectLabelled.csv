1,2,1143,Landmark Purchase!,"The LS50s are simply some of the finest bookshelf/stand-mount speakers I have ever heard. I've heard comparative offerings from most of the major players (and some of the smaller ones) and while many models have their redeeming qualities, these babies just flat out sing like nothing else.

It's remarkable - when dialed in right, and fed/driven by qualified gear, they actually disappear from the room and the only thing left is just you and the music. It seems like such a simple thing, but until you actually experience it, descriptions pale in comparison.

In a nutshell, when these things are at their best they perform on such a high level it's ridiculous. 

Two things to note, for potential buyers:

1) 8 ohms seems a bit optimistic. Measured performance, averaged out, is probably more like 6 ohms (and as low as 4 - per Stereophile). Just be sure your amplifier is up to the task. My Parasound A21 has no trouble at all but does run a bit warmer than with some B & W's.

2) They are indeed a little less sensitive than some others, but don't let that dissuade you. Just be mindful of it.

3) The bass these produce is incredible. It's more than enough for my oddly shaped 9x20x10 room (and my neighbors). If you have a large room and/or just like a lot of presence with the lowest octave then you'll want a sub.


The better the gear you can throw at these the better they will perform. I am currently in awe of how awesome they are and how luck I am to own them.


If you're reading these reviews, just do yourself a solid and pick up a pair. Try to buy from your local dealer if at all possible. Often they'll work with you, and supporting your community is more important now than ever!

The LS50s will add joy to your life. And in the end, joy is what this is all about.

2,3,1143,Works fine with low-powered tubes!,"A local dealer made me an offer I couldn't refuse, so I bought these speakers without having an opportunity to audition them. I was a bit uncertain because the specs indicate that the LS50s require some power, and my (restored) Fisher 400 tube receiver is rated at about 28 wpc. 
I had nothing to worry about; the Fisher has plenty of juice to get the LS50s singing in my little 9 x 12 listening room. Compared to my previous speakers (rated at 90dB efficiency vs. the KEF's 86dB efficiency), I only have to notch up the volume knob slightly higher to achieve the same level.
My conclusion is the quality of the power source is more important to the LS50s than the amp's nominal rating; the transformers on the Fisher 400 are pretty beefy.",P,quality
3,4,1143,Excellent workmanship and service,"I've had KEF (3005s) as my original HT system for several years in my den and am very happy with them; but I always wanted a set of stereo speakers for my living room for those cozy fireplace moments. I tested number of speakers including dynaudio, B&W, MAs and several others. The LS50 blew them all away in terms of sound stage and clarity. Currently powering them with an emotiva xpa-200 amp and their new dc-1 DAC. I listen to mostly digital music and these sound awesome in this combination! Thanks for making my holiday season even greater.",P,quality
4,6,1143,Highly Recommended,"I listened to some KEF floorstanding reference speakers about 10 years at a speaker boutique and got hooked on high end audio. Unfortunately, I've always been buying speakers on the affordable end of the audiophile spectrum and constantly bitten by the upgrade bug as a result. These speakers are about twice as expensive as any that I have previously owned but they deliver far above their price range.Perhaps my favorite feature is their ability to play perfectly (to my ears) when off axis. I don't have a dedicated listening room, so it has been common for the best listening position to be some spot standing in the middle of the room. Now, I can fully enjoy my music from anywhere in the room. Upgrade bug officially squashed.

FYI - I mostly listen to classic and indie rock. Power with an Exposure amp and a Centrance DAC with all-digital sources.",P,"quality, price"
5,7,1143,Giant Killers - Can't Be Beaten for Less than 5-10x The Price,"I was stunned that all the reviews were right about these fantastic speakers - they truly are Giant Killers, especially for their price.

They're beautiful and their sound qualities are just as amazing - when set up correctly. They do require special care in set up to sound up to their potential. Any critical comments you may have seen, likely result from improper set up. 

To sound their best, they must be placed out in the room, away from the walls, and with their ports fully open. In that configuration they really do disappear in a wall of lifelike sound, with a great soundstage and imaging. 

Of course their other sound qualities are superior as well - great bass, mids, highs, tone, tenure, texture, timbre - very real, lifelike sound, without any boxy constraints. 

They really do have bass, despite their specs - though, if you're a HT, or car audio buff, who loves inaccurate, boomy sound, you may be disappointed. I'm using the R400b with them, but they really don't need it, except for the very lowest notes.

They also require a powerful amp with high current output - 200+ w per channel into 8ohms. They're fairly inefficient. 

And... I'm using them with the DSP Anti-mode 2.0 to eliminate the ""room boom"" - especially with a sub. Makes integrating a sub a ""piece of cake."" And... provides a very good pre-amp, as well. Add a tube buffer, as I have, and the sound doesn't get much better. 

A great source, such as a great SACD player with XLR cables makes everything even better!

Do yourself a favor... and get a pair of these... unless ""you have money to burn,"" and can spend $50K on your system, which is what it will take to better them. ",P,"quality, price"

5,9,1143,These speakers are little gems!,"I have owned a number of loudspeakers over the years starting with Polk, Martin Logan, Magnepan and Gallo. While they all had their strengths, none have impressed me as much as the LS50's. From the excellent build quality to the balanced sound and deceptive small physical size, these speakers are impressive. The LS 50's disappear and present the music with accuracy-,clear highs, articulate, realistic vocals and punchy bass-the LS50's are so enjoyable to listen to. For the size and price, they are hard to beat.",P,"quality, price"

Test Music 

Vinyl - the most crucial test 

Buckingham Nicks - ""Crying in the Night"" from German LP Pressing - Incredible album - musically and sonically - but has never been re-released and the US vinyl copies universally suck - the German pressing is quiet and Lindsey's guitars jumped out into the room with me 

Fleetwood Mac - ""Dreams"" - from recent 45 rpm double LP - This pressing beats the Japanese SACD and the US DVD-A. Its often a toss-up between these three formats (if a recording is lucky enough to get all 3) but the vinyl in this case is the winner - clean, quiet and ultra-transparent 

Olivia Newton-John - ""Country Girl"" - from Japanese Pressing of Long Live Love LP - Japanese vinyl is meticulously well crafted and regardless of what you think of this aritst,, her early country recordings (coming out of England) with Cliff Richard's old Shadows band on back-up and producing - are magnificent. Great guitars, superb sonic layers, and a clear, clean voice that some speakers can't get right - but not the KEFs! 

CD 

Eagles - ""New Kid in Town"" from the West German Target CD - very early ""flat"" transfer - sounded superb - this is the Eagles CD to own - later versions have tinkering with the sonics 

SACD 

Eric Clapton - ""Give ME Strength"" from 461 Ocean Boulevard - guitars were warm and sweet and jumped out at you 

Olive Server - I hate compression but Olive does pretty well 

Vanessa Williams - ""Midnight Blue"" from ""Everlasting Love"" - great cover of the Melissa Manchester classic - sounded much better than I expected.

10,12,1143,Simply Amazing,"I must say that I am amazed at these little loudspeakers! My current speakers are ProAc Response 2.5 which were purchased well over 10 years ago at a cost of $5,000 – the current model is called D28 which represents a slight improvement and retails for $6,250 . The KEF LS50 simply buries them! Dynamics, imaging, clarity – it’s all there. Alright, so the ProAc’s have a stronger bass, but frankly I prefer the KEF’s lighter touch, seems more in scale and certainly adequate. I am finding myself pulling out all these old records I haven’t listened to for years and enjoying it immensively, never would have thought that a mere change in technology could rekindle musical enjoyment, but there’s no arguing with success.

Five hours in they opened up and made music. Easy to discern individual sounds and instruments when there is a lot happening in the soundstage. Solid imaging. Could be a bit deeper, but that may improve with more hours and positioning experimentation. Voices are the person singing in front of you. They are getting smoother and more open as the hours add up. They need power. Wimpy amps need not apply. Bass is taught. Highs are non-fatiguing. They are capable of great dynamics and will play loud, clean, and do so like music! Would loved to have heard the R's. I suspect they are that much better yet.

Second, the entire package for the KEF X300A is impressive:
The sound quality is *stunning*. The sound stage is deeply 3-dimensional.
The layout of the connection ports, controls, & power is simple & ergonomic.
The design of the speakers is aesthetically pleasing.
The manufacturing is to an almost artisanal-level of craftsmanship.
The materials and components are top-notch.
The packing of the speakers in the box is thoughtful, secure, & clean.
The *cardboard* constituting the box is sturdy & hi-quality.
The feng shui of the entire experience is, shall we say, harmonious
and, i'm willing to bet, would astound Steve Jobs. :)

Third: The KEF X300A is a complete audio delivery system designed
for the digital source of yr choice: iPod, laptop, or desktop.
The KEF X300A provides an onboard DAC that can handle up
to (96kHz 24-bit) files and bypasses the source computer's
built-in (usually lo-quality) DAC thru a USB connection.
The KEF X300A is *not* ""computer speakers"" in some low-bar
attempt to exceed the paltry audio out of most computers.

Finally be *forewarned*: if u acquire the KEF X300A, u will be
kicked up more than a couple of notches and feel compelled to ditch yr
.mp3 files for .aiff (44.1kHz 16 bit) & hi-rez FLAC (96kHz 24-bit) files!

If yr source is a laptop, u will want to stream those hi-rez files off an SSD:
Samsung 840 EVO-Series 1TB 2.5"" SATA III SSD; MZ-7TE1T0BW:

One more appreciated touch: i've spoken a couple of times to the folks at

14,36,1201,As good as it gets,"I wanted access to my main music library (being) converted to digital music audio files (AIFF) including Hi-Res downloads with no loss in fidelity, without spending a ton of dollars for integrated or separates, cables galore and as close as possible to the SQ (sound quality) I experience from my main system which includes KEF Reference 107s (circa 1986). Be it known, I am wedded to KEFs -- in my bedroom, HT and now a fourth system. I also wanted simple and direct setup. I chose speaker stands made to order instead of a desktop configuration and adjusted the EQ. The supplied plugs to regulate bass were appreciated but not needed. Of the several options for connecting to my main system in another room (5m cable made this possible), I chose USB (hoping for the best SQ) from Mac Mini to the X300As. The other connection options, Airplay via Airport Express, Bluetooth dongle received as a pre-order gift from KEF, or stereo 3.5mm analog port were not implemented. First impressions of the SQ were disappointing playing files in iTunes no matter what resolution. Hmmm, new AB amps, new 96/24 Dacs, new everything. Launched my favorite player, Amarra Symphony, and replayed the same files. Ah Ha! Different result: Everything changed (for the much-much-better). So this is what X300As sound like even new out of the box. I was delightfully surprised by the ample bass, very favorable mids, the Highs out of the gate need some more time. Cymbals and drums, horns, voices were resonant without sibilance. Coherence evident. Sound stage big. To be thorough, ease of adjusting the gain visually or by touch is not: While I appreciate the admonition to lower the gain to avoid damage to the drivers, there is no détente that I can feel to discern the middle position, or if there is a middle for the gain adjustment knob, I was able to detect that position; and a contrasting color on the knob itself would have made it easier under certain conditions. While I accept the responsibility for a longer USB cable when needed I would have appreciated longer USB cables then what was supplied. I doubt very many buyers will use them for desktop with the level of performance these speakers are capable of delivering. To sum up: The X300A is well designed and fabricated, attractive aesthetically, and for the price and performance, the X300As are as good as it gets.

12,37,1203,Convenient Upgrade from the X300A,"Having used the KEF X300A speakers in my desktop system for over a year I was already familiar with their superior sound quality, dynamics, excellent build quality and easy operation. Properly oriented on the desktop they provide an realistic soundstage and immersive listening experience. The move to the KEF X300AW cousin was primarily for the added convenience of the wireless operation.

Observations:

-the KEF X300AW sounds exactly the same as the KEF X300A

-with Apple products there is no compromise in the sound or seamless wireless operation

-with Windows based computers it is only possible to play through Windows Media Player (an issue for Windows users who want to use other players or streaming services such as Pandora or Spotify)

15,39,1199,Just Wanted to Add Some More,"In my previous review I failed to mention the fact that the M500 can be easily powered by an i-pod. With 15 hours in, the phones have opened up even more & with that comes an increase in volume that is as clean & pure as it is at lower volume. In addition, the 500's outperform several open back phones that I have such as the Grado SR 225i & Sennheiser HD-598.

1,40,1199,Oh No Not Another Company Coming Out With Headphones,"An electronics salesman told me the KEF was going to introduce their version of over the ear headphones as well as in-ear phones. My immediate reaction was ""oh no"", not another company entering the market. After I settled down it began to sink in, ""this is KEF"" meaning I have to look into this. I am an audiophile but not the type who examines each & every detail to the point of overkill. Too much detail is too much for me. Let me say that this was easily the best headphone purchase I've ever made & I've made way too many.I have some top rated phones like the PSB MU 4 2 as well as the Sennheiser Momentum,, & so forth.) Those cost more than the M500's & don't come close to the precise details, imaging, imaging ,soundstage, etc. The 500's are pure magic when it comes to reproducing all types of music & do so on a grand scale. Beauty & comfort make up the rest of this very fine product which operates with such ease. The fit & finish is typical KEF (meaning as good as it gets) & while they are on ear phones, they provide very good isolation. I've taken them outside & walked sevral miles in very warm weather & the faux leather ear pads & headband do not heat up like so many other headphones do. Am I surprised?, of course not because I figured KEF would wait until they got it right. So back to the Oh no response, because this 500's surpass all of my other phones, Oh yes, applies here. The case is very nice & the cables are flat & wonderfully flexible. The i-pod cable as well as the standard one are very high quality & blend well with the magnificent aluminum body. At $299.99 they're an absolute bargain, bar none. My wife doesn't believe me when I told her that the 500's may very well be my last headphone purchase. I'm really not sure where I would go from here so I'll leave it at that.",P,"quality, price, miscellaneous"
2,42,1200,WOW-Amazing sound-Very KEF like-Love it,"To begin with, I must say that I am a very satisfied KEF Reference 103.2 speaker owner since 1983 (30 years). I love the sound of those speakers so much that when I learn that KEF was now producing headphones, I had to try them. Since I spend more then 10 hours commuting weekly (in a mix of buses,trains and subways), I decided for the in-ear M200.

A few years ago, I did try some well known other brand in-ear headphones in the same price range but I was not satisfied. The sound was good but not good enough to make me forget the many disadvantages. You could not walk nor eat while listening to music because every slite move of your neck or jaw muscles was changing the ear-canal shape and affecting the sound quality. At the same time, I could hear the sound of the bud tip rubbing inside my ear-canal. From that experience, I decided that ""in-ear"" was not for me. Nevertheless, since the M200 were from a company I respect so much and even though there were no review available at that time, I decided to try ""in-ear"" again to make those so many commuting hours more enjoyable. 

The M200s comes in a very well made and ""Apple"" like classy packaging. They looks very high tech and well engineered. I was blown away by the sound. I never expected that the sound would be so good, very detailed and crisp, voices are so natural and basses are clean tight and so deep (not boomy). On one particular song, I was hearing cracking sound from the recording studio floor that I never heard before. So enjoyable, very Hi-Fi, Bravo KEF.

There are only two drawbacks. FIRST, in-ear is definetly not for everyone. The M200 are not some kind of tiny, mini buds. They have some volume for some reasons. Each bud is a two-way speaker arranged much like a big Uni-Q driver (used in high-end KEF speakers) and, all those very low bass sounds required some room/volume to expand. This is why they are not small and that the flexible arms are nessary to support and position them properly. It took me four days to find the proper fitting and positionning to get the full pleasure that those headphones can induce. Now I feel that you can definitely walk confortably with them but you will probably not run nor ear or chew gum while listening to music with them. 

SECOND, while I love my KEF speakers for rendering a realistic 3D like sound with precise instruments positionning on the stage IN FRONT OF THE LISTENER, a headphone, ANY headphone, will never render that same sensation of space just because the music feels more in your head then on the stage in front of you. But at the same time, you would not expect either to hear a Berlin Philharmonic Orchestra, a Dire Strait, a Patricia Barber or an Adele concert in the train.

Anyway, I now have 800+ albums in my iPod library that I have to re-discover with my KEF M200 while the other commuters have to figure out where does that smile come from.",P,"quality, miscellaneous"

7,67,1153,"Holly Cow, What Phenomenal Sound","I am of course the very very lucky winner of the HT-Guys 10th year anniversary grand prize – the Kef R-Series 5.1.2 Dolby Atmos Speaker System: 4 x R100, 1 x R200c, 1 x R400b, 2 x R50.  I am so grateful to you guys, and to Dippin from KEF for this amazing prize.
I apologise for the delay of this long overdue email, but with work, travel and other engagements, I did not have the time to fully test out the speaker system before now. Holly cow what phenomenal sound.
First thing I wanted to point out is that I never bought individual speakers in the past.  I have a limited budget for my home ‘entertainment’ setup, and I always put more of an emphasis on the television itself than the audio equipment attached to it.  I did have ambiophonic setups in the past, but I’ve always had all-in-one systems with the inexpensive speakers that came with it.  I always thought that the quality was decent, that I could experience all the audio mixes available correctly and that the speakers were fine for my needs in a small apartment.  My last setup was an Onkyo HT-S5500, 7.1 Channel Home Theater Package.  The Onkyo HT-R591 receiver that came with it does have the height input, so I was able to plug in the R50 speakers, even though it is not an Atmos enabled receiver.
Wow, what a jump, I feel like I went straight from from preschool to postdoctoral studies.  The first thing that is apparent is the shear power of the R-series set of speakers, which most certainly is due to the bigger drivers.  Prior to receiving the R-400b subwoofer, I had done a calibration with the rest of the speakers.  I was surprised how well these small speakers could handle low-end sounds.
After a kerfuffle with U.S. / Canada customs (basically they destroyed the subwoofer and sent it back to KEF), I received the R400b.  I did a proper three-position calibration using the Audyssey microphone.  Well wow … what can I say.
Music:
I am so used to listening to mp3s or streams on the go, that I didn’t think that it would matter much to me listening to music on such a system.  Boy was I wrong … all of a sudden you rediscover new elements in music you thought you knew extremely well.  I pay for the Rdio music service, which basically allows me access to a seemingly limitless catalogue of albums from a browser.  There is also a Roku app for this service and this is the main source of streaming music to my audio setup.  I realise this is not an ideal source, but the 192 kbps streams are good enough for me.  There is a 320 kbps version, but I don’t really hear a difference.  I would love for someone to point out a piece of music where they actually hear the difference between a 192 kbps vs 320 kbps bitrate, and what to look out for.
I decided to use music I am quite familiar with to test out the system.
“David Bowie: Earthling” – I’m Afraid of Americans (Rdio)
There are such a variety of tones in this track and the speakers render all superbly.
I’ve never felt the low tones this way; not a wash, just exactly the tones as they are supposed to be … but with such power that after 1 min I had to stop it in fear of forever ruining my reputation as good neighbor.  This is going to be tricky … I’m going to need to spy on my neighbours to find out when they are not home so I can fully enjoy my setup.

 

“Miles Davis: Ascenceur pour l’échafaud” soundtrack (CD & Rdio)

 

I have listened to this music for such a long time on various formats (tape, CD, streaming), so I figured this would be a good test case.

 

The first thing that was obvious was the hiss in the 1998 CD release of the 1958 recording.  I never noticed this before, not that I was paying attention to it, but this is a testament to the quality of the speakers that I can notice it.  On the re-mastered version, which was available on Rdio, the hiss was absent as expected, however I did notice a bit of gating (is that the correct term?).  Basically I felt that the removal of the noise signature took a little away from the original elements, especially noticeable on the tenor sax.  But this was very slight and obviously has nothing to do with the speakers, but the mastering itself.  What a wonderful experience to listen to this piece on these speakers.  After twiddling around with the different modes of the receiver, I stopped on the Dolby Pro Logic IIz – Height setting, since it seem to provide more ‘presence’ … the effect of which gave the impression of having the musicians in the room with me.  For the first time I was aware of each individual player with all there expressiveness.  This was absolutely clear when I could hear each individual brush stroke on the snare and the subtle accents.  It gave me a whole new appreciation of the musicianship and the timeless quality of this recording.   For those of you thinking of getting the R50s to enhance your sound, I strongly recommend it as it gives more breadth and more frontal power, which enhance the illusion of having the musicians there with you.

 

Actually I'd like to know what do you guys recommend as audio mode when listening to music ?



""Gyorgy Ligeti"" – Continuum / Atmospheres / Ramifications

 

There are recordings that just beg for a multi channel aural space, anything by Gyorgy Ligeti for instance.  For those not familiar with this composer, just think of any memorable moment in a Stanley Kubrick film and chances are it’s enhanced by music by Ligeti.  It’s a music that requires precise speakers, because his compositions often play with rhythmic layers that create phasing, where every note is important.  If the sound is muddled, the effect is lost.  The KEF speakers render these effects perfectly, since again, the individual voices can clearly be heard.

 

Everything I put through it (Jazz, Rock, Folk, Classical, Electronic) sounded phenomenal to me. I never thought that surrounding myself with sound would be so pleasant, but also heighten my awareness of the musicianship by hearing very precisely the contribution of each player.  This was only made possible because of the dynamics and accurateness of these R-Series speakers.

 

 

Movies & TV:

 

I have very few 7.1 mixed films in my collection, as I tend to purchase more foreign classics in ‘full glorious mono’ (as a friend would put it), but I did have ""Prometheus"" by Ridley Scott, which I used to test out the speakers.  Right from the start, with the rolling military snare drums of the 20th Century Fox Fanfare and thunderous thump of the bass drum, I was transported into the theater.  In the introductory scene, there is a waterfall … the roar of it was quite phenomenal and then a massive alien ship hovers into the frame with substantial low tones passing overhead.  In the past, I’ve had systems that could deliver a good rumble to the room, but this is the first time I can say I could distinguish the tones of these two low hums … and even though there was absolutely no denying the power of these tones, I didn’t feel that it was simply just making the walls shake … it was clearly connected to what I was seeing on screen and totally engulfed me into the experience of being there.  Granted, this has to do with good sound design, but I think I would not have gotten this if it weren’t for these speakers.  With regards to the R50s, I have the impression they were also quite active during this sequence, because I did have the impression that the low tones of the ship were coming somewhat above me (though I realise that probably all speakers are involved to achieve this specialization).

 

I’ve also been listening lately to the Daredevil series on Netflix.  Having a Roku, I do get the Dolby Digital + mix.  In light of the fact that this character is blind and has an enhanced auditory sense, the sound mix is used quite effectively to convey this ability, especially during fight sequences.  All the thumps and positioning effects are quite vivid with these speakers and dialogue very clear in the center channel.

 

Sincerely, KEF literally brought the theater into my home and now I understand why you guys (Braden & Ara) sometime say how much nicer it is to have this experience in your own home.  As you often pointed out, the speakers make all the difference … and now I fully agree, speakers should be the number one priority of any enthusiast.

 

When I’ll have the budget for it (in the new year), I will get a full blown Atmos enabled receiver and let you guys know of my impressions.  For now I’ll just be enjoying the speakers thoroughly on a daily basis.

 

Thank you HTGuys and KEF… you rocked my world!

 

Now for the tricky part: Avoiding Eviction.

45,8330,1350,Not expected inconvienience at such high price with 1 major flaw,"I have been using these speakers as my primary desktop speakers. I love the sound quality that these speakers produce and they look really good too while doing that. I was really happy till one fine day I was studying and they started playing music while on standby... I checked all my tabs in chrome, could not find the source for the music... I noticed it was connected via Bluetooth, which was weird since I directly play them through the desktop always, have used Bluetooth only while testing initially. After further testing I found that the Bluetooth of this system is always discover able when not in use too. This has lead to quite a few headaches for me, one night while I was sleeping someone connected to the speakers and started blasting music through them. After contacting KEF regarding this, they said the only way to really avoid this is by using a power strip and switching of the speakers when not in use and they did not have any solution for it yet. This is really inconvenient since 

1) I like to listen to music before sleeping, now I cant fall asleep listening to it since I have to switch it off.
2)Placing a power strip at an accessible position would negate all the work I put in to get my desk clutter free. 

This was not something that I expected from such an expensive set of speakers and a reputed brand name such as KEF, there are much cheaper products from no name brands that understand the importance of not allowing a Bluetooth device to be always discover able, I don't understand why engineers at KEF would do this, there is no practical reason to have them always on.
